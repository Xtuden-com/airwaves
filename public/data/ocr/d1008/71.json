Seay\nPeg© $\nSeptember 22, 19$$\nof course far from the income needed, it does represent great progress as\ncollared to the $1,000.00 a year dues income of the NAEB only a few short\nyears ago.\nIn view of the crisis which education now faces, it is our belief\nthat say steps which would force stations out of the Association, or would\nplace membership principally on the basis of ability to pay rather than on\nthe basis of need or educational position must be guarded against at all\ncost®. The NAEB is the only association available to educational broad¬\ncaster sa It has equal concern for all wireless media and all instructional\nlevels. For it to become a small group of only one or another kind of fi¬\nnancially prosperous stations would mean returning to the status which pre¬\nvailed before the present Kellogg Grant was made* And this would be un¬\nthinkable«\nOne other aspect of the dues and income problem which claims atten¬\ntion is the legitimate eoBpetition of other organizations which also dis¬\ntribute communications materials. These include BAVI (the Department of\nAudio-Visual Instruction of the National Education Association) with its\nTape Repository which distributes instructional tapes for non-radio usef\nthe Educational Television and Radio Center with its TV station distribu¬\ntion,—a service which is supplemented by distribution of its films for\nnon-broadcast use by the Indiana University Audio-Visual Center* the NPAC*\nand various others. For the NAEB to attempt to solve its financial prob¬\nlems by competing for sources of income now used by these organizations\nwould also not contribute to the overall cause of American education®"
