Nevertheless, the increasingly important services and functions of the organ¬\nization must be coordinated by a permanent staff. This staff was set up and a\nnational headquarters created with funds provided by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation\ngrant. It is only the existence of this permanent staff in Headquarters which pro¬\nvides the mechanism to make possible the NAEBxs handling of other grants from other\norganizations and foundations and to carry on the responsibilities and services of\nthe Association."
