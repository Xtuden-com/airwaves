Skomia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dr. Skornia:\nThank you for letting us know that the 1954 monitoring study has\nnow been printed. We shall appreciate it if you will send\nindividual copies of this study to the names and addresses on\nthe lists we are enclosing. It seems better for the distribution\nto be handled this way than for you to send the publication in\nbulk to us here. We shall be glad to reimburse you for the\npostage and any other expense which you may incur in sending\nthem out for us.\nThe copies to our Board members, to Messrs. Gaither, Berelson,\nMcDaniel, and Eurich, and to our grantees should be accompanied\nby the little slips, bearing Mr. Fletcher*s name, which we are\nenclosing. The \"special request\" list and the youth organizations\nwill receive a letter from Pasadena stating that the monitoring\nstudies are being sent under separate cover.\nThe following list of magazines and newspapers represents those\nto which the previous New York study was sent from our New York\noffice:\nLadies Home Journal\nWomans Home Companion\nThe New York Times ~\nThe New York Herald Tribune\nThe New York Daily News\nThe World-Telegram and Sun\nIt seems to us that the monitoring study would more appropriately\nbe sent to these people directly by the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters instead of by the Fund. Will you please\ntherefore take care of this list in your own mailing.\nYou will note that we have included a list of our grantee organiza¬\ntions which we believe would be interested in the study. If the\nNAEB, however, would prefer to send the publication to these\n&C. ' ' ~L)\nm- ■- ^rters\nJUfi 24 1354\nt"
