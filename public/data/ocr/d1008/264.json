Acceptance of educational broadÂ¬\ncasting as a tool of education which commands respect, has increased greatly.\nThe number of stations and institutions joining in the common effort is rising\nsteadily.\nWe believe the state of health of the NAEB and of educational broadcasting\nin America is good. Both have far to go. But we owe thanks in large measure\nto the grants of the W, K, Kellogg Foundation, which have helped education to help\nitself in this area, and have provided the NAEB with a staff, office and funds\nwithout which it could never have secured and administered the funds and support\nof many other organizations as well. Both the NAEB and educational broadcasting\nare approaching the development we visualized for them at the time of our first\nrequest to the Kellogg Foundation, prior to the first grant, made May 23, 1951.\nOur sincere thanks are hereby registered to the Foundation whose generosity,\nfaith and tolerant understanding have made this progress a reality,\nH, tt.
