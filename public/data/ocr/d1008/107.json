The\ntransmitter was placed in a rear\nfold of the costume, and the antenna,\nconsisting of a multi-turn loop, was\nworn as a belt.\nShows Flexibility\nThe demonstration, designed to\nshow the flexibility and freedom of\nmotion made possible by the NBC\ntechnical development, was staged\nin Studio 3-B in Radio City.\nThe signal put out by the tiny\ntransmitter is picked up by a loop\nof wire encircling the work area.\nIn the case of outdoor programs, the\nloop can be laid on the ground, sus¬\npended from trees or draped in\nbushes or practically any other\nnatural setting.\nThe entire assembly—microphone,\ntransmitter with battery, and loop\nantenna—weighs slightly less than\neight ounces. Small size of the unit\nis made possible by the use of finger¬\nnail-sized transistors, which do the\nwork of vacuum tubes. Eight RCA\ntransistors are used in the trans¬\nmitter.\nThe transmitter, when its design\nis finalized, will be little larger than\na pack of king-sized cigarettes. The\nlaboratory model used in the dem¬\nonstration is somewhat larger, in\norder to facilitate circuit develop¬\nment. Eventual dimensions will be\n% in. x 2 in. x 3% in.\nThe range of reception of the\nminiature transmission has not yet\nbeen fully determined, but tests\nhave shown no difficulty in covering\nan area of 5,000 square feet, NBC\nengineers said. They added that the\nsystem is not vulnerable to most\nsources of interference, but in areas\nwhere interference might be a prob¬\nlem, an increase in received signal\ncan be achieved by reducing the\narea covered by the receiving loop,\nthereby improving the ratio of sig¬\nnal to noise.\nThe transmitter is powered by an\nRCA alkaline cell battery which is\nexpected to furnish five hours of\ncontinuous, reliable transmission.\nThe unit develops approximately 50\nmilliwatts of power at about 530\nkilocycles, but radiates less than 100\nmicro-microwatts. Because of the\nlow power and low frequency, the\ntransmitter does not require licens¬\ning, since it is well below the limits\nprescribed by the Federal Com¬\nmunications Commission for such\nievices.\n★ ☆ TELE TOPICS\n• ON WEDNESDAY EVENING NBC-TV premiered a new 15-\nminute series, “The World of Mr. Sweeney,” starring Charlie Ruggles\nas a home spun philosopher who runs a general store. It turned out\nto be an interesting property though someone nearly flubbed the\ndub at the very beginning by not realizing that Charlie Ruggles is\na humorist, not a comedian. Some contrived gags left over from a\nslapstick show were thrown into the first few lines of the script but\nfortunately this treatment lasted only a few minutes, then Ruggles\nwas able to proceed with the business of creating the slightly pixie\n“World of Mr. Sweeney,” a feat accomplished lightly and gracefully,\nonce the right tone had been established. Starting next Tuesday the\nshow becomes a four-times-a-week feature, with each episode intro¬\nducing a new situation calculated to induce quiet laughter. This\nprogram should build up an enthusiastic following quickly.\n• YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, Du Mont’s strongest TV personality,\nBishop Fulton J. Sheen, and his popular “Life Is Worth Living,”\nprogram received one of the 12 top radio and TV awards of the\nNational Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Clubs,\nInc. The award was made at the organization’s convention in St.\nLouis. . . . The Baltimore TV Circulation Committee reports 549,782\nTV sets in that metropolitan area as of June 1. . . . KHQA-TV,\nHannibal, Mo., reports 67,627 sets within grade B contours and\n115,998 sets within MU/V contours, as of June 15.\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n• TODAY’S TV PERSONALITY: JOSEPH H. ROHRER, president\nand general manager of Pike’s Peak Broadcasting Company, owner\nand operator of KDRO and KDRO-TV, Colorado Springs, Colo.,\nentered broadcasting at a tender age, becoming\none of the first “hams” in that city while still\na boy. After graduation from Colorado College,\nhe took his first professional radio job with NBC\nin Denver in 1934. He became operations super¬\nvisor in charge of studio engineering at KOA,\nDenver, but resigned in 1947 to build and manage\nKDRO. KDTtO-TV was a natural outgrowth of\nthis successful radio operation, going on the air\non channel 13 as an NBC affiliate with a telecast\nof the Sept. 30, 1953 World Series game. A full\nprogram schedule was put into effect immedi¬\nately. Besides participating in every phase of his\nfirm’s radio and TV operations, Joe is active in all important civic\nfunctions.\n• NIELSEN RATINGS of the top ten evening programs viewed\nin the New York area during the four-week period ending June 12,\ntell the fairly familiar story of “I Love Lucy” leading the pack by\nseveral lengths and “Dragnet” coming through in its role of perennial\nrunner-up. “Lucy,” reached 56 per cent of the estimated 3,930,0o0\nTV homes in the 21 counties within the 50 miles radius of New York\nCity. “Dragnet” was far below the “Lucy” rating with 41.3 per cent\nbut from there on down through the list of metropolitan choice, the\ngradations are very fine. “The Jackie Gleason Show” stood third\nwith 40.5 per cent and was followed by “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent\nScout,” 39.9 per cent; “Red Buttons,” 37.8, and “This is Your Life,”\n35.8. “The Arthur Godfrey and His Friends” program was judged\nas two entities because it had different sponsors on different nights.\nIt placed both seventh and tenth with 34.5 per cent for two perform¬\nances and 33.1 per cent for the other two. Eighth and ninth on the\nroster were “Ford Theater,” 34.3 per cent, and “I’ve Got a Secret,”\n33.3 per cent.\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n• WEST COAST NOTES: William Dempsey, educational director\nof KPIX, San Francisco, has been chosen by the U. S. National\nCommission for UNESCO as one of the three American TV producers\nto attend an international discussion and study group in London,\nstarting July 5. . . . Jack Beck’s Westwood Productions will make a\npilot film for the new Peggy Lee TV series, “Meet Me at Peggy’s,”\nsometime this month.\nAd Agency Execs. At\nCBS TV Color Forum\nMore than 200 advertising agency\nexecutives were present Wednesday\nin CBS TV’s studio 21 to attend a\nforum on color programming con¬\nducted by Richard Lewine, execu¬\ntive producer of the web’s color\nprograms, plus other members of\nthe network’s color staff.\nHuibbell Robinson, Jr., CBS TV\nvice-president in charge of network\nprograms, gave a brief, opening\naddress, in which he said the\nforum’s purpose was to share with\nthe agency executives the network’s\nknowledge in all phases of color\ntelevision production.\nE. Carlton Winckler, production\nmanager of color programming for\nCBS TV, then outlined some of the\nthings the network had learned in\nits color work. He advised that color\nbe looked upon as a new tool . . .”\ncolor television is not a new me¬\ndium, and the things we learned\nin black and white still apply in\ncolor.”\nPlanning Important\nHe said that pre-program plan¬\nning was of the utmost importance\nin color TV . . . “it’s the key to\na good color show.” Scenery, he\nadded, should be simple, so as not\nto drown out the message of the\nstory. He also pointed out that be¬\ncause of the impact of color, sets\ncould be smaller, and set dressing\nshould be simple, in soft color. Sim¬\nple, even street make-up, is enough\nin color TV.\nLighting is vitally important in\ncolor, Winckler also stated, with\nlow lighting best to get transparent\nshadows.\n“We’re approaching an interesting,\nexciting period,” he told his audi¬\nence. “CBS TV will not be satis-\nfled with less than top quality color\nand top quality programs. All the\nexperience we have gained in color\nwill be placed at the disposal of\nour advertisers.”\nA question-and-answer period\nfollowed, with Lewine and Winckler\naided in answering the ques¬\ntions by John Koushouris, engineer\nin charge, color television opera¬\ntions; Sal Bonsignore, supervisor\nof lighting, color programs, and Mil¬\ndred Trebor, co-ordinator of cos¬\ntume design, color programs.\n1st Godofsky Scholarship\nWHLI, Hempstead, L. I. has\nawarded its first annual $500 Elias\nI. Godofsky-WHLI Memorial Broth¬\nerhood Scholarship to a sixteen-\nyear-old Farmingdale, L. I. girl.\nThe award was presented to Carole-\nMarie Runge high school senior by\nPaul Godofsky, president and gen¬\neral manager of the station who\nestablished the scholarship in honor\nof his late brother—first president\nof the station."
