  "text": "Mr. Harry J. Skornia\n-2-\nAugust 16, 1956\nIn your letter of July 25th you explain the salary schedule used\nin drawing up your proposal. With our approval of the budget given\nabove for 1956-57 we are approving the individual salaries as stated\nin your letter. No one of these salaries should be increased during\n1956-57 without approval from the Foundation. The salary schedule\nfor 1957-58 and the one for 1958-59 should be presented at the beginning\nof each of those years and approval of them requested. Along with your\nrequest for salary increases you will probably request a slightly larger\nbudget. This will be possible since for 1956-57 you will not use all\nof the funds originally allocated for this year. You understand, of\ncourse, that during the three-year period the total commitment is not\nto exceed $141,000.\nOur Foundation's check for $46,221.00 is enclosed. We have omitted\nthe odd cents figure in order to simplify our accounting. This check\nis our payment for your 1956-57 budget. Please acknowledge receipt\nof it.\nIf there are questions or adjustments which you have in mind, please\nfeel free to contact me.\nSincerely and with best wishes,\nMaurice F. Seay\nMFS/fh\ncc - Mr. Frank Schooley"
