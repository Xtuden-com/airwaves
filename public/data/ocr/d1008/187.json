Consider giving grants to specific people for\nspecific study projects to bring about upgrading in specific areas of need. Those\npersons could get an intensive education in their area and then pass the benefits on\nto their staffs. Each station could be given a choice of the area in which they wish\nto nominate a scholar.\nSub-committees\nWynn appointed sub-committees as follows to meet immediately after lunch to\nconsider problems in the specific areas and bring back recommendations to the\nwhole committee.
