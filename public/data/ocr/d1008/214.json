  "text": "Item 25\nREPORT OF THE NAEB PLACEMENT SERVICE\nApril 1, 1956\nSince its last report (which indicated considerable progress* you may recall),\nthe activities of the Placement Service have leveled off so that we now have\na steady day-to-day operation instead of sporadic periods of great activity.\nBaring the last five months the Placement Service has not handled the quan¬\ntity of openings it did in preceding months0 Naturally, we have no explana¬\ntion for this fact: either budgets will not permit expansions or educational\nbroadcasting employees are becoming more settled, It is fair to say, how¬\never, that on a percentage basis more employers have expressed definite in¬\nterest in our candidateSo\nThis greater interest is due to our increased number of fully qualified\navailable personnelo We have made great strides recently in increasing\nthe registration of candidates possessing both higher academic degrees and\nactual experience in the broadcasting fieldo Unfortunately, such person¬\nnel are a bit older than the bright young Bachelor of Arts candidates$\nthus, these more mature candidates are reluctant to accept salaries not in\nline with the costs of moving, housing and feeding a family, The situation\nis unfortunate, but nevertheless true; and some solution should be forth¬\ncoming if educational broadcasting is to continue attracting the type of per¬\nsonnel it needs so urgently«\nOur method of operation is similar to that employed prior to the last re¬\nport, The initiation of a new method of reporting vacancies has greatly\nincreased the efficiency of office work and has increased the rapidity with\nwhich credentials can be sent to employers. The cooperation of the employers\nis urged in using these cards.\nOne area in which we are still lacldng is that of getting technical person¬\nnel registered with us. The demand for such personnel continues to be\ngreat, and our inability to assist employers in this area is a source of\ngreat regret to us.\nIn summary, we may state that the Placement Service is in good condition\nand capable of handling almost any request. Our record of progress continues.\nRespectfully submitted by;\nRobert E, Underwood, Jr,\nPlacement Officer"
