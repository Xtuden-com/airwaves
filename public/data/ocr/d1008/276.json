Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Dr. Seays\nIn the HAEB acceptance of the Kellogg grant for 195&-59, one\nstipulation says, 11*0 #7, ‘’Any salary increase or contribu¬\ntions to retirement plans above those planned in the budget\nwhich is submitted with this agreement are to be provided by\nthe Association unless approved in advance by the Foundation.\"\nI assume this refers to the totals and that the Foundation is\nnot concerned with any item by item change, so long as NAEB\nstays within the budgeted total, or assumes any increase over\nthe budgeted totals. Am I correct?\nIn June 1 attended Regional meetings in Denver and San Francisco\nbecause Skornia couldn’t make them. At both meetings, without\nany suggestion on my part, a number of expressions of apprecia¬\ntion to the tf. K. Kellogg Foundation were made by those attend¬\ning. I’m happy to tell you of these events. Moreover, I believe\nyou would have enjoyed seeing the real good, serious considera¬\ntions given to educational broadcasting problems by those in\nattendance.\nI imagine things are humming at the Foundation these days. How\ndid the June meeting go? It would be good to have an opportunity\nto talk with you again one of these days.\nSincerely,\nFESsoJf\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident"
