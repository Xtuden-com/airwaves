C.\nNAEB Calls For Fully-Equal Second Service\nThe need for a communications satel¬\nlite system to serve all facets of educa¬\ntional broadcasting and telecommunica¬\ntions techniques was emphasized in a\nrecent statement fded with the FCC by\nthe NAEB. The FCC asked for com¬\nments on proposed changes in the do¬\nmestic non-common carrier communi¬\ncation satellite structure. The associa¬\ntion also asserted its belief that the\nFCC does have existing authority to\nlicense the sort of satellite system pro¬\nposed by the Ford Foundation last\nAugust.\nThe NAEB stressed that a satellite\nsystem designed to serve educational\nends can succeed only in conjunction\nwith strong land-based educational\nradio and television stations which\nsatisfy the local needs of their respec¬\ntive communities. The association urged\nthat there should be a correlation be¬\ntween the development of a communi¬\ncations satellite system and ground-\nbased regional and local outlets.\nIn reference to the Ford Foundation’s\nintention to use funds from its proposed\nnon-profit satellite corporation for na¬\ntional and regional non-instructional\nprogramming, the NAEB suggested that\nsuch financial support could also be\napplied to instructional radio and tele¬\nvision and be used for such community\nservices as education of illiterates, the\nhandicapped, the pre-schoolers, welfare\nrecipients and job trainees.\nLegislative Support Cited\nNAEB recognizes, the statement said,\nthat the FCC may wish legislative sup¬\nport before acting on the Ford pro¬\nposal. If such legislation is forthcom¬\ning, the NAEB underscored two points\nwhich should be incorporated:\n(1) development of a ‘second service,’\nwhich would provide fully equal re¬\nsources, channel space and talent, for\nnon-commercial broadcasting and (2)\nthe necessary funds to make the second\nservice work. The NAEB called at¬\ntention to the fact that “commercial\ntelevision stations which now predomi¬\nnate numerically 754 to 167 authorized\nnon-commercial educational stations,\nare almost exclusively entertainment\nand news media .... Diversity in pro¬\ngramming thus is lacking .... much is\nleft .undone .... By contrast, non¬\ncommercial educational licenses ....\nhave no obligation to reach mass audi¬\nences at all hours of the broadcast\nday .... Both Congress and the Com¬\nmission should recognize that, with\nproper material assistance, non-com¬\nmercial educational broadcasting sta¬\ntions can perform a significant public\nservice programming function . . . .\nTo achieve a true programming balance\nand diversity for the American public,\nthe Congress and the Commission\nshould not look to the commercial\nstations to do the non-commercial ed¬\nucational job, nor should the regula¬\ntors look to the non-commercial educa¬\ntional stations to do the commercial\nstations job.”\nInstant Transmission Urged\nThe NAEB stated it was a regulatory\nobligation to “structure a system of\nAmerican broadcasting that will fulfill\nall of the public’s needs by encourag¬\ning a total broadcast service voluntarily\nand eagerly pursued by each of its\ncomponents.”\nThe association endorsed the instant\ntransmission that a satellite system\nwould make possible because a simul¬\ntaneous nationwide offering has a far\ngreater chance of becoming a regular\npart of the pattern of radio and TV\nprogramming. Satellite transmission\nwould also tend to expand the use of\nthe media in schools and provide the\nopportunity for instruction in forms of\ncontinuing education on a scale now\nunheard of, NAEB noted.\nJANUARY, 1967\nR & D Moving Ahead\nPlans for the expansion of a Research\nand Development department at the\nNAEB are gaining momentum as the\nNew Year gets underway, according to\nPresident William G. Harley. As the\nfield of educational broadcasting moves\ninto 1967 .... a year of anticipated\ngreat growth and expansion ..... Mr.\nHarley has expressed his confidence\nthat private industry and philanthropy\ncan be counted upon to bolster NAEB\nefforts in this direction.\nIn promising meetings already held\nwith foundations, manufacturers and\nrepresentatives of commercial broad¬\ncasting, the urgent need for additional\nstaffing of the headquarters office was\nunderscored by the increased pressures\nupon NAEB for service and leadership.\nCreated by such developments as the\nFord Foundation’s satellite plan, the\nforthcoming Carnegie Commission re¬\nport on Educational TV, and proposed\namendments and extension of the Edu¬\ncational Television Facilities Act.\nMr. C. Scott Fletcher, a public mem¬\nber of the NAEB Board, is heading up\nthe drive which has a minimum goal\nof $100,000. Networks, selected stations\nand manufacturers are being asked to\ncooperate.\nThrough the R & D office, the NAEB\n(Continued on Page Three)\nSchramm Essay In\n“Monograph” Series\nThe fourth publication in the Mono¬\ngraph series issued by the Instruction\nDivision of NAEB is in preparation and\nwill be available in early February.\nThe title of the forthcoming publication\nis ‘Non-Commercial and Instructional\nTelevision: Promise and Opportunity,’\nby Wilbur Schramm. Mr. Schramm’s\nstudy, in its original form, was part of\nthe Ford Foundation’s filing before the\nFCC in mid-December when interested\nparties were asked to comment on the\nestablishment of a communications sa¬\ntellite Siystem by non-governmental\ninterests."
