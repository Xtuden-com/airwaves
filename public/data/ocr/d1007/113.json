  "text": "\"...history was made in educational broadcasting.\" These were\nthe words John Dunn, Director of NAEB Region V, used to describe the first\nregional conference in NAEB history. This conference was a long dreamed\nof high point of the past year for NAEB. It was finally possible this\nyear under terms of the grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.\nRegion V of NAEB is composed of the states of Missouri, Kansas,\nColorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana. This land\nof wide open qsaees was also a land of great distances between educational\nbroadcasters. Many of the people who found it possible to attend this\nconference with Foundation help had in the past literally never talked to\nanother person engaged in educational broadcasting. Who then could better\ncounsel these people than practical educational broadcasters? It was thereÂ¬\nfore logical that the national officers of NAEB, all practical educational\nbroadcasters, be chosen as the consultants for this meeting.\nThe results will be felt for a long time. Immediately they can\nbest be summed up by quoting two paragraphs from the report of John Dunn, who\noriginally fathered the idea of regional divisions of NAEB and who sparkplugged\nthis meeting,"
