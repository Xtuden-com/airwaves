Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Greek, Michigan\nDear Bob:\nOn behalf of the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters I wish to acknowledge with sincere thanks\nyour letter of January 24 in which you advise us that\nthe Kellogg Foundation is increasing its total commitment\nto NAKB in the amount of $3,743*00 as requested in my\nletter of September 29, 1954. This amount is to pay the\nsalary of the NAFB Associate Director, Harold S. Hill,\nduring the fifth and final year of the Foundation's\nsupport of the project.\nYour personal understanding and support of the\nproject, as well as that of the Foundation’s, are most\nsincerely appreciated. I am sure you know this even if I\nwere not to write it.\nIt was good to see both you and Dr. Seay in\nDecember, although we missed you in New York. I am sure\nthat much good will come out of the New York meeting,\nalthough, as I told Dr. Seay, the Kellogg Foundation\nhad a background that most Foundation representatives at\nthat meeting did not have. His letter to Dr. Arthur Adams\nwill prove most helpful, I’m sure.\nKind personal regards,\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFBS:fbh\ncc: Harry J. Skornia"
