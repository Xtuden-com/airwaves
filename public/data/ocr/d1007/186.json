In this way the program could be\noperated as a specific grant-in-aid program involving only those specific institutions\nrather than a mass scholarship program.\nWynn - This plan would take considerable time and if it is decided to do this,\nprobably no scholarships should be offered in the summer of 1956.\nBrowne - (Referring to fact that many 1955 scholars were dissatisfied with the\ninstitution or workshop they attended) These scholars have no one but themselves to\nblame, since they chose the place they wanted to go.\nGeneral discussion - Leaving the matter of choice to the scholar often reflects\npoorly on the NAEB. Also, some of the funds are thus poorly spent.\nHead - Could not the committee accept or reject applicants partly on the\nbasis of school indicated, even though announcements would not specifically indicate\nthat this procedure would be followed?\nRickard - Not sure that scholarships provide the best means for professional\nadvancement. If the money can be used in other ways perhaps it should be. General\nbroad scholarships are not really the business of NAEB."
