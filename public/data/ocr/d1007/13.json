It is possible\nthat sonaa of the recordings we control might be placed on the open market. We are\nawaiting the reaction of a recording company to this possibility at present. How¬\never, the outlook is not so far particularly optimistic, and this item could prob¬\nably not realistically be expected to yield income much in excess of the $2,000.00-\n$3,000.(X) per year which we have been able to achieve with rather aggressive pro¬\nmotion of album sales to date.\nAt the present time the Executive Director teaches one course per year\nand serves as a thesis advisor for the University of Illinois School of Journalism.\nThis reduces the amount of his salary which must be paid by the NAEB, but also\nconsiderably increases his work load. It is possible that if he were to teach more,\nand if perhaps other members of the Headquarters Staff could do the same, the salary\nload for the NAEB central staff could be somewhat reduced. This is not believed to\noffer much more potential than is at present being realized, however, since the\nlimit of human endurance is soon reached and the amount of work of the Association\nis increasing rather than decreasing.\nThere is obviously room for considerable other developmental thinking\nand discussion regarding additional possible sources of income. (NOTE TO BOARD:\nVarious types of endowment and trust approaches, for example, need considering by\nsomeone more versed in such long-term financing than yours truly, perhaps by a\ncommittee.)"
