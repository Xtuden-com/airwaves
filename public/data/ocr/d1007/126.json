With its\narrival now seemingly only a matter of days away, we are making many plans\nnot only to adequately use this piece of equipment but to change the operation\nof the network so that it can more speedily and more surely distribute the\nmany fine programs which are available to it. The jnajor hope is that we can\ndispense entirely with the system of legs and start a system of direct disÂ¬\ntribution to each member station. We are also looking forward to handling\nsome exceptional program material especially the Adult Education Projects\nThe arrival of the duplicator means not only a change of methods\nbut also a change of personnel and their duties. These plans are again well"
