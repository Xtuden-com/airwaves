  "text": "I have thought that there need not he a meeting in February as we had last\nyear* The reason is that almost none of the projects suggested last year\nhave come about, largely because funds have been lacking to implement them.\nI believe that we should try to get some of these going before we think up\nnew ones. I am sure that we can get some dollars for starting one of the\nprojects.\nTwo of those proposed last year have great merit. I believe that they can\nbe started and much done with a few dollars. I believe that we can get\nthe Board of Directors to give this committee enough to get the projects\nunder way. I am thinking first of the proposal to get research done in\ninstitutions through the offering of a grant for expenses in return for\nassignment of one of our studies to a graduate student under supervision\nand under our conditions. This involves the making of a list of desired\nstudies and getting the information to schools. I believe that we should\nget this one organized so that by next fall we can have some studies under\nway under such assignment.\nThe other project was the compilation of research data in educational\nbroadcasting and to become the recognised depository for such information.\nThis was Herman Rammers suggestion, you will remember.\nThink about these. I would appreciate suggestions as to how we may get\nthem into action. Do you have any ideas either for the work or how much\nwe could do the job for. I am willing to request funds but I believe\nthat we need to be specific and to have a constructive plan.\nThanks for your help in the past. I hope that our committee can produce\nsome significant contribution again this year. Let me hear from you.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Bob\nR. J. Coleman, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\nCopied NAEB Eq,\n4/5/56 jy"
