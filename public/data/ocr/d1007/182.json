Based on Dr. Henry’s mention at Convention that new school buildings needed\nto be planned and built with the needs of radio and TV in mind. At the present time\nthis proposed short course is running into some problems and nothing definite is\nplanned as yet.\nWynn - Should the committee be considering seminars specifically for radio?\nBidlack - Reported that the Engineering committee wants to hold one that would be\nspecifically for radio. This would be a seminar for engineers from small member\nradio stations"
