  "text": "This is BBC Calling\nAs part of WNYC’s role in the international radio exchange the programs listed below were carried by the\nmunicipal station during 1947.\nNever has a City Station dramatic series achieved the critical acclaim accorded the five (5) BBC transcribed\n“World Theatre” plays. This series consisted of superb dramatizations of:\nRostand’s “L’Aiglon”\nMarlowe’s “Dr. Faustus”\nEuripedes’ “The Trojan Women”\nShaw’s “The Man of Destiny”\nIbsen’s “Hedda Gabler”\nThese plays were magnificently performed by Great Britain’s foremost actors and actresses including Dame\nSybil Thorndike, James McKechnie, Alec Guinness, Barbara Couper, and Eric Portman. They resulted in literally\nthousands of requests for more of the same. WNYC, which never underestimates its listeners’ intelligence, is justly\nproud of having brought American radio these incomparable British productions.\nAnother part of the joint WNYC-BBC programming was the BBC London Newsreel which carried, to American\nlisteners, British reports of News from their land and from the continent. These Newsreels had more than entertain¬\nment value — time after time they proved their real value. Like the BBC Pleasure Parade, the BBC Newsreel was\nwritten and produced by the staff of the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n-8-"
