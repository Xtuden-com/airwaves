  "text": "For the Children\nIn 1947 WNYC expanded its programming for children. Most important of the special broadcasts arranged\nfor juvenile listeners was the Board of Education series. These programs virtually became part of the New York\nCity’s school curriculum. With 875 schools in the metropolitan area relaying the programs over their loudspeakers\nto tens of thousands of students, the municipal station’s radio fare came increasingly to the attention of younger New\nYorkers. WNYC’s programs for children weren’t completely devoted to school listening. Here is a partial listing of\nprograms WNYC carried for the children.\n“The Children’s Story Fair”\nheard once weekly throughout the year.\n“Here’s Heidy”\nheard once weekly throughout the year.\n“The Christmas Holiday\nDrama Festival”\na special cycle of plays for children heard during\nthe Christmas holiday season.\n“Something For Young Folks”\n“City Fun With Children”\n(parent-child audience)\n*“Books Bring Adventure”\n“Book Parade”\n“News of The New World”\n“Drama Time”\n* WNYE Originations.\n*“Let’s Look At The News”\n“Pioneers of Science”\n“Spanish Program”\n“Know Your City”\n“Board of Education Drama Series”\n“Junior High School Forum”\n“Tales From The Four Winds”\n“This Way To Story land”\n“Round The Year”\n“Assignment UN”\n“Great Day In Books”\n“Accent on Opera”\n-34-"
