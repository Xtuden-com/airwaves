Griffith\nRadio Station WOI\nIowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Mr. Griffiths\nThis will thank you for your kindness in sending me material to be\nused at our NAEB appearance before the FCC. You may be interested in the\npresentation which was checked by our attorney, Horace Lohnes, and I am sending\nyou a copy in its final form. According to Mr. Lohnes, this presentation was\nquite effective and in his opinion the educational interests stand a good\nchance of being assigned 15 FM channels. Hope to see you in Chicago next\nweek, where I will report in detail regarding the hearing.\nYours very truly.\nCarl H. Menzer\nDirector\nCHMjJM\nEnel*"
