We try\nto got the mailing list of people who wrote in to your station two\nyears ago and then look thorn, up and find out, if such is the ©aae,\nwhy they stopped listening* It is from such an approach that w©\nlearn about conditions unfavorable to your work which you might be\nable to overcome if you just know them®\n\"(4) The final point to be mad® is the coordinating efforts which our\noffice pursues through the different fellows* Station WQXg for\ninstance, which is our host today, has a unique feature in its novel¬\nreading program* We have studied it quite carefully and we are"
