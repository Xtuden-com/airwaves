I would cooperate with every state and local agency available,,\nworking with the Chamber of Commerce, with the school Board, with\nwomen*t organisations, welfare and fraternal groups, in an attempt to\nrender the best community service possible* I say, \"working with\" «\nby that I mean, I would not merely say to any of them, *yes, you can\nhave fifteen minutes or a halil an hour on such and such, a day or\nnight *, but I would discuss the possibilities of an interesting program,\nhelping them to make it more than 9just another talk** I think\nrather than work Individually with each of these groups, I would\nattempt to get them to pool their resources and efforts and work\ntogether0 In fact, I think I would try to set up a community advisory\ncounoil for the station, which could be a clearing house for programs,\nThey could also be my *hair shirt* by forming constructive listening\ngroups* Those groups need not listen merely as an aid to the station^\nbut for their own edification as well* Valuable research work could\nbe done this way, which might be tied up with the radio course which\nI would definitely establish in the University curriculum. By making\nthis course available to the members of the advisory council or\nlistening groans, at a small fee, a means of financing some of the\nwork of the department might be found* The advisory group would need\nlittle money to finance itself - their wwn members could be trained\nto write and help in production, and members of student drama groups,\ncourses or clubs could be cast for dramatic productions, if and when\na dramatic production was needed* Personally, I think they are over-*\ndon© in many instances, often times forcing material into the drama\nform when it is not dramatic to begin with* I would tie in the local\nboard of education as well, so as to make the group all-inclusive as\nfar as elementary and adult education was concerned in the community*\n\"In my radio course, I would have the students working on new and\ndifferent radio techniques, instead of trying to ape the programs\nwhich are on the air* I would make every effort to train speakers*\nYou cannot give a person without a personality, a radio personality*\nBut you can give him a better delivery and a real style. You can\nmake the subject matter of any speech easier to listen to and easier\nto read, and if the material is interesting in itself, undoubtedly"
