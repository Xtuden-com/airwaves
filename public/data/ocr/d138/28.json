These should be people of experience and stature in instruc¬\ntional television. Perhaps each should identify himself or herself/ with a very brief\norientation as to where and in what situation this experience has been gleaned.\nTESTIMONIALS:\n(1) It is clear that there are some instructional functions television\ncan fulfill superlatively. As a presenter, it can offer almost\nunlimited material/ effectively prepared, to be received with\nclarity, immediacy, economy of time and effort. It can present\nto the students a breadth and depth of visual experience nowhere\nelse obtainable with such flexibility and ease.\n(2) Television has neither brains, integrity, nor feelings... no essen¬\ntial moral or intellectual nature of its own. It has no ability except\nto communicate, but if used skillfully, it can communicate exceptally\nwell. However, let us not forget that instructional television must\ndepend importantly upon classroom teacher guidance for determination\nof its content, presentation, and effective utilization."
