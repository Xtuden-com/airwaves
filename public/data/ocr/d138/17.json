  "text": "Treatment for Kit No. 2\npage seventeen\nAs the Narrator speaks the next lines, he is inserting in the \"problems\" device other\nproblem symbols: \"INDIVIDUAL STUDENT DIFFERENCES\" - \"NEW EXPERIENCE\nLEVELS\" - \"FACTS, SKILLS, ATTITUDES\".\nNARR: Through whom will these come?\nWhat is to work this essential magic?\nWho is to perform these vital and exquisite tasks?\nWho or what CAN?\nNot the individual teacher working alone ...\nHere we shift to an individual teacher's classroom situation. Here in a conventional\nclassroom with 35 or 40 students, TEACHER (NAME CAN BE SUPPLIED WHEN WE KNOW\nWHO THIS IS ... BUT FOR TREATMENT WE WILL SIMPLY USE \"TEACHER\".) is involved\nin the presentation of a concept: man as a creative and adaptive creature. Teacher's\npresentation may be embellished a bit, but essentially it goer like this:\nTeacher shows picture of a cheeta. (This can be done with a visual device .. • slide\nprojector, overhead projector, etc ... or we may here illustrate difficulty students\nhave in seeing where teacher has no devices to help.)\nTEACHER: This is a cheeta . •. the fastest animal in the world.\nMan is not as fleet as the cheeta.\nTeacher shows picture of an elephant."
