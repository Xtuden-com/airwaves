Did\nthe pupils get what the television teacher said? Did they all get it? To determine\nthis is the responsibility of the classroom teacher , in some instances, says the\nNarrator, a few well-chosen questions will be enough. Making the point that the\nclassroom teacher does not re-teach the television lesson, the Narrator calls attention\nto the classroom teacher's approach: \"The television teacher said so-and-so. What\ndid she (or he) mean? \" \"Evidently you didn't understand....\" \"Let's investigate\nand see„....\"\nPerhaps the classroom teacher, with his unique awareness of these pupils' needs and\nabilities, will feel that the important thing is extension of the main points in the les¬\nsons or enhancement of the lesson content.\nSometimes, says the Narrator, the classroom teacher will choose to continue pro¬\ncesses initiated by the television lesson, feeling these are essential to make the lesson\ncomplete. \"I'd like you to go on with the work suggested by the television teacher.\""
