A teacher\nand a pupil. . .facing each other. . .from opposite ends of a log. In\nspite of its simplicity, this must have had considerable impact. . .\nintellectually AND EMOTIONALLY. Because it has been one of our\nmost cherished and enduring forms. Crops up every now and then in\nconversation even today. Though. . . since the original script has long\nbeen lost. . .nobody knows precisely just what was learned in that\nparticular. . . and potentially passive. . . circumstance. It could have\nbeen a concept. It may have been a skill. How to sit quietly on a log. . .\nand look your teacher squarely in the eye. . .face to face. . .without\nflinching. . .falling off the log. . . or letting your foot go to sleep.\nSince then, down through the years, we've had productions of every\nvariety.\nSome in which the students read over the shoulders of their fellow learn¬\ners facts attached to the side of a building."
