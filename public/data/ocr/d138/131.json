Here we need some footage of large\ngroup, small group, and individual activities from MPATI, Dade\nCounty, or some other center.\nAs we see large group activities, small group activities,\nindividual effort, utilizing certain of the various media, the\nillusion of the audition should be sustained by the Director,\nwho sets up the scenes...describing in advance what is to take\nplace, stipulating who will take part, and what he wants to emerge\nfrom the scene. If possible, it Would be effective to hark back\nto oUr \"Access\" stage set...with the camera going through one\nof the drawn or penciled areas to get the scene in progress.\nA few times, as he is setting up his scene, the Director will\nask television to take some role which television cannot take...\nand Miss M who is the classroom teacher in whatever\nillustrative material is chosen for the kit, will be seen taking\nher part in the sequence.. .directing, guiding, ^vising.. .working\nclosely with the students, stimulating the students to further\nreinforcing activity. There should be opportunity in these se¬\nquences to see some feedback activity between the television\nteacher and the classroom teacher.».either by conference, report,\nor a visit of the television teacher to the classroom."
