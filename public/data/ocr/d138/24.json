He indicates his problem spectrum.\nWe see the need. Where can we see the answer to that need.\nPerhaps TEACHER has suggested that, too. He reminds us of what TEACHER has just\nsaid about extending man's powers of teaching and learning. • • through the tools of\ncommunication. He suggests that perhaps the very environment which has posed our\nproblems offers us also some solutions. Let's look around us and see. Let's look at\ntelevision, as one of a rich repertory of resources offered us by the Twentieth Century.\nTelevision is a versatile medium and can do much. What it can do best for you in\nyour particular situation, the Narrator tells the viewers, depends upon your need.\nFor school systems differ.. .and schools differ.. .and students are not the only people\nwho have individual differences. Teachers, let's remember, have them, too. One\nteacher's special competence may well be in another teacher's area of lesser skill\nor professional interest. Let's watch television doing some of the things it can do,\nsuggests the Narrator, while you (the viewer) consider which of these would make\nthe greatest contribution toward meeting your needs and helping you, your class¬\nroom, or your school system, move closer to your goals."
