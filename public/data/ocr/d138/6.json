This can be done by drawing on the chalk¬\nboard ... or by using figures or symbols on a flannelboard or a magnetboard ... or\nby a kind of portable bookshelf device, with the teacher at one end, the principles of\nlearning at the other, rather like bookends . . . and the problems enumerated on blocks"
