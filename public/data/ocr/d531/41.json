  "text": "2 • In-School Programs\nOne hundred and eighteen separate series of varying lengths\nin sixteen subject areas were presented for use in the elementary\nschools. The five appearing most often as series are Science,\nMusic, Social Studies, Art and Hygiene. When ranked by total\nnumber of programs, however, the first five are Science, Music,\nSocial Studies, History and Art.\nOf particular note is the fact that almost one-third of\nthe entire number of individual programs produced for elementary\nschool use were in Science and, although lessons were not always\ndirected toward a single grade level, fifth grade Science was\nby far the most often-presented subject.\nForty-five separate series or courses were telecast in six¬\nteen subject areas for the secondary schools. The five most\noften presented series were in Science, History, Guidance,\nBiology and Literature. Because of the greater difference in\nnumber of programs per series in the secondary school lessons,\nthe ranking in terms of numbers of programs per subject area\nbecomes: History, Literature, Geometry, Science and Algebra.\nIn both elementary and secondary schools the emphasis on\ncertain subjects results from the schools’ assessment of their\nown needs. Because it is unlikely that these needs will change\nin the near future, the television experience that has been gained\nin these subjects will be particularly valuable for future\nprogram resource reference.\n35"
