At other times, material\nmay be of a strictly research nature for the preservation of data\nin the same sense as motion pictures are used in the fields of\nmedicine or other technology.\nThe regulatory rules governing the licensing of television\nremote pickup circuits and similar allocations of broadcast micro-\nwave, do not specifically permit the use of such circuits for the\ntransmission of video information which does not have ultimate broad¬\ncast usage. Interpretation of this point is essentially subject to\na rather liberal range since it is difficult to ascertain what\nmaterial might subsequently be selected for broadcast. In other\nwords, intent concerning the end usage of a recorded program some¬\ntimes rationalizes the legal use of broadcast microwave circuits\nfor diverse applications so long as the material has potential\nbroadcast value.\nNeedless to say, this interpretation can be carried too far and\nfuture use of these channels to serve the many conceivable needs of\na closed circuit nature would trespass on the intent specified in\nthe Federal Communications Commissions Rules.
