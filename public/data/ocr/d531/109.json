This, of course, will make the existence of a legal structure,\ncorporate or otherwise, literally mandatory.\n2.3 Licensing and Allocation Considerations.\nAt the present time, the allocation of frequencies and con¬\nstruction permits for microwave stations comprising a network service\nmight be given consideration under Section Rules 21.700, 4.601 (b)\nand 4.601 (c) of the Federal Communications Commission’s Rules and\nRegulations. These services are entitled, respectively, as follows:\nNature of Service Section\nPoint to Point Microwave Service (Common Carriers) Rule 21.700 (et al)\nTelevision STL Station (Studio - Transmitter Link) Rule 4.601 (b) (et al)\nTelevision Inter-City Relay Stations Rule 4.601 (c) (et al)\nThe first of the above categories (Point to Point Microwave\nService) is the only section rule under which common carrier corpora¬\ntions might seek appropriate construction permits for network circuits.\nThe remaining two categories provide that the licensee must be an\nexisting television broadcast station. In these latter two categories,\nit is not unusual to find rather extensive network links operated by\nindividual stations or groups of stations that are unfavorably located\nwith respect to common carrier trunks. However, these operators\nqualify for inter-city or long haul STL circuits by virtue of their\nstatus as licensed broadcasters rather than as common carriers.\nIn the latter two categories, legal responsibility for each\nrepeater site must be assigned to a given broadcast station rather\nthan to a group, unless of course all participating broadcast stations\nare commonly owned. An example of this form of network is described\nin Part 2.4 of this study in an evaluation by B. J. Klindworth.\n103"
