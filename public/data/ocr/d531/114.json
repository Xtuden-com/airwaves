  "text": "Despite the fact that the circuits described in Mr. Klindworth's\nreport must be classified as \"impaired\" from an engineering point\nof view, they were nonetheless serviceable and acceptable within\nthe users’definition.\nThe following table portrays the factors of the distances\nand number of hops involved in some of the conceivable network\npaths. These of course, do not include additional networks which\nmight tie in at some point on the system, and it does not include\nany of the secondary paths which utilized, in part, an off-the-air\npickup.\nMiles # of Hops\nTotal simultaneous circuit miles 1611 57\nLongest interstation path via shortest 750 26\ndirection (Grand Forks to Des Moines\npath circuit)\nIt is interesting to note that two manufacturers of equip¬\nment in the class being considered, state that the maximum number\nof repeaters for which they will hazard high grade microwave per¬\nformance characteristics, are 8 hops and 13 hops respectively.\nThis is in sharp contrast to the number of hops in the circuits\nunder consideration and it gives some clues to the projections of\nperformance being attempted herein. As desirable as it might be to\nplace an actual engineering figure of merit on video information\nbeing transmitted through some of the longer paths in this system,\nthe task goes beyond the present limits of inquiry into equipment\nof this class.\nThe equipment which is manufactured by AT&T for use in their\nsystem is, unfortunately, not available on the commercial market.\ny\nL-l\nJ\nu\nJ\n1*1\nJ\n108"
