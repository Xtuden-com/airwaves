  "text": "Finally, it can be stated that a plan for administering the\nnetwork, which has met with the unanimous approval of directly-\nconcerned persons in all six states, has been devised and that\nthis plan obviates legal objections to the use of the network*s\nservices by public or private schools, colleges or universities*\nEngineering\nThe Engineering Plan envisages a double system, micro-wave\nrelay connecting present or potential VHF stations at Lincoln,\nNebraska; Ames, Des Moines and Iowa City, Iowa; Milwaukee and\nMadison, Wisconsin; the Twin Cities and Appleton, Minnesota; FreeÂ¬\nman (Sioux Falls), South Dakota; and so back to Lincoln. From this\nline one branch would go to Duluth-Superior and another, by way of\nFargo, to Grand Forks, North Dakota. From Lincoln a secondary\n(one-way) system for Western Nebraska is provided at additional\ncost. From Freeman and Fargo Western South Dakota and Western\nNorth Dakota may respectively be served. It is contemplated that\neach station on the primary network could both receive and transmit\nprograms, and that each would have a video tape recorder which\nwould enable it to store programs for local release at the most\nopportune time.\nSuch a system would be many times less expensive than one\nserved by common carrier cable, and much less expensive than one\nserved by video tape only (necessitating a large tape inventory).\nThe technical quality to be expected from such a network\nwould be, if not equal to live transmission, at least equal to a\nmedium grade kinescope recording such as are frequently used\n3"
