The total\nnumber of hours of programming directed to the schools, however,\nis augmented considerably by the use of filmed materials and\nkinescope reproductions of lessons which afford more exposures\nfor class viewing convenience.\nPresent programming in Educational Television also reveals\nan increase in the number of different subjects offered for\ncollege credit, as well as the inclusion of more general community\nprogram series whose content organization from week to week\ndemands more than occasional viewing.\nIt is sufficient to say that the overall picture of current\nEducational Television programming in the six states, when viewed\nin the light of the past, is one of continually accelerating\ngrowth. More institutions of higher learning are presenting courses,\nmore school systems are producing programs for classroom use, more\nagencies from the community are involved in educational tele¬\nvision, and increasing numbers of people from these organizations\nare participating in the greater number of programs being telecast.\nUo"
