  "text": "FOREWORD\nThe development of Educational Television from its first\nstation only seven years ago to the present fifty stations, with\nnumerous supporting institutions, has not been the product of\neither caprice or accident* This growth and development has taken\nplace largely because of tremendous educational needs which only\nEducational Television can fill both well and economically* These\nneeds, of course, are the twin necessities of providing an ever-\nhigher quality of education to an ever-increasing number of students*\nOnly Educational Television among modern educational tools has\ndemonstrated an ability to cope successfully with both the qualita¬\ntive and the quantitative needs of education of and for our times.\nFor this reason it is entirely logical that, in literally\ndozens of areas, educational television leaders are now beginning\nto plan in terms of state and regional networks. For, if one station\ncan bring the highest quality of education to hundreds of thousands,\na network can bring the same superb quality of education to millions.\nWith this in mind, the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters, under the terms of a generous Grant from the Louis W.\nand Maud Hill Family Foundation, directed me to pursue this survey\nto determine the feasibility and desirability of a six-state Educa¬\ntional Television Network in the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota,\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The present report is the\nresult of that survey.\nI"
