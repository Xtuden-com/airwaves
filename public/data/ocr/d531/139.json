Commercial channels could be changed to an education¬\nal reservation by request and upon FCC approval.\n\"Drop-in\" indicates that an additional VHF channel may be\nadded by requesting the FCC to add the desired channel\nat a specific location. The drop-in channels noted have\nbeen recommended by Cy Braum of the J.C.E.T. and are present¬\nly available, subject to F.C.C. approval upon request.\n6.2 State of Iowa - Channel by Channel Considerations.\n6.2.1 General.\nThis state has two VHF reservations, one of which is active.\nThere is also a commercial channel owned and operated by Iowa State\nUniversity. No additional channels will be available in the fore¬\nseeable future. All of the Iowa stations are primary stations\nlocated on the main microwave loop and thus would be major users of\nand contributors to an educational network.\n6.2.2 Ames - WOI-TV, Channel # 5 (Active, Commercial).\nThis station is operated by the Iowa State University and\nis fully equipped for full power operation as well as for local and\nremote programming. Although WOI-TV operates on a commercial channel\nassignment, its ownership and educational service policy strongly\nsuggest that it be considered as a part of this study. The Iowa State\nUniversity has had a dominant role in the entire development of ed¬\nucational television over and above its activities in commercial\ntelecasting.\n6.2.3 Des Moines, KDPS-TV, Channel # _11 (Active, Reserved).\nThis station is licensed to the Des Moines Public School"
