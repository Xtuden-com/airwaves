Therefore, it has been assumed in all matters comprising this\nstudy, that the network, if constructed, would operate as a private\nnon-profit common carrier corporation.\nAs has been pointed out in other sections of this study, the\nachievement of reasonably useful picture transmission over sub¬\nstantial segments of the network will require that adjustment to\nindividual equipment units be highly optimized. It is felt that such\nmaximum optimization cannot be met by a pattern of operation which\npermits a division of engineering responsibility over circuits\nwhich affect vital positions of the network. Therefore, the system\nmust operate under a central agency.\nIt is the considered engineering opinion expressed in this report,\nthat central responsibility for all technical aspects of network\ntransmission be a mandatory specification for acceptable performance.\nIt is also felt that similar firm measures of centralization are\nneeded for traffic control operations which, of course, tie in closely\nwith technical quality.\nInitiation of the third phase of the engineering study referred\nto in paragraph three, should logically coincide with the establish¬\nment of the network’s corporate structure, both administrative and\nengineering. Nearly all the points to be dealt with in this phase\nwill require the network’s ability to take action in a truly legal"
