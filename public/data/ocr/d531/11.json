  "text": "Costs\nThe cost structure of the network is detailed below. Let it be\nsaid first, however, that the costs of a network program must be divided\nby the number served which tends to render the unit cost infinitesimal.\nFor example, a teacher at $3#00 per hour who teaches 30 children in a\nclassroom for an hour would mean a unit cost of 100 per hour per child.\nThe same teacher, teaching 30,000 children by an educational television\nnetwork means a unit cost of 1 of a cent. Unit cost fades almost into\nT0(!)\ninsignificance -when it is realized that nearly two million two hundred\nthousand school children would be within range of network stations. If\nto this is added the fact that only by television is it possible, at\ntimes, to provide a teacher of chemistry or German or algebra to thousands\nof children, the economic necessity of an educational television network\nbecomes clear.\nCosts (capital) for establishing the network will be about\n$2,000,000. Approximate costs by state (less at least a 10$ educaÂ¬\ntional discount) will be as follows:\nIowa\n$ 501,070.\nMinnesota\n781,163.\nNebraska\n191,596.\nNorth Dakota\n139,958.\nSouth Dakota\n228,1*55.\nWisconsin\n31*6,333.\n$ 2,188,575.\n5"
