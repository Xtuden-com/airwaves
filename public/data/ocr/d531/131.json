This figure includes tubes,\nparts, building upkeep, road maintenance, tower maintenance, and all\nthe miscellaneous costs required to keep the system in operation.\nDivision of operating cost among states has been allocated\naccording to the number of 2 way primary system hops located in each\nstate. Depreciation is in accordance with primary equipment cost\nallocated to each state. We feel that the operating cost estimates\nshown are conservative for a system of this size.\n125"
