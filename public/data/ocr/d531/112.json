The quality of the signal was\nexceptionally good with very little additional degradation\nin picture quality than that observed at WDAY in Fargo.\nKBMB-TV of Bismarck is serviced by an independently owned\nand operated microwave system on 2000 mcs., using Federal\nlinks with subcarrier sound channel. Their service is an\noff-the-air pickup from Valley City passing through three\nhops to their transmitter. Again, this network picture was\ncomparable to the CBS picture in Fargo with very little\nadditional degradation apparent.\nThe picture was next checked at Williston, N.D., which has\nNBC service through seven hops of Lambda-Pacific STL equip¬\nment. This is a closed loop system which originates from\nthe KFYR transmitter and is then fed by way of Minot to\nWilliston. The quality of the picture at Williston was\nvery good on local Bismarck shows and showed little addition¬\nal degradation of the network signal. They are also using\na subcarrier sound channel on the microwave which makes the\noperation of the system critical. The system provided a\nuseable monochrome picture and indicated that reasonably"
