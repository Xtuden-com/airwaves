  "text": "It will be noted that the plan covered in Mr. Craswell's\nletter involved 744 circuit miles with monthly charges totaling\n$39,894.00. If the service arrangements were tc be maintained for\na period of 10 years (120 months) no portion of the termination\ncharges shown would become due. However, if service were to be\ndiscontinued at a time less than 10 years from its inception, the\nremaining prorated portion of the termination charge would become\ndue.\nThe basic termination charge covers, in part, the capital\nliability incurred by the carrier in behalf of the user in establish¬\ning circuits over new routes which have no other immediate revenue\npossibilities.\nNote that the 1952 estimate covers only one way circuits\nto each of the several cities. This would preclude program origina¬\ntion at the outlying points unless second circuits were installed.\nIn order to ascertain the applicability of the 1952 North¬\nwestern Bell estimate, contact was established with Mr. Newhouse who\nis presently in charge of the company*s Commercial Department.\nMr. Newhouse indicates that there have been no significant\nchanges in the basic AT&T formula, and that for our purposes, the\nearlier figures are sufficiently accurate. He indicates however,\nthat the basic termination charge calculations are now usually based\non a 36 month minimum. Furthermore, the extent of construction which\nhas occurred since 1952 may reduce the actual need for basic termina¬\ntion charges over portions of routes which may be involved.\n8.2.2 Sample Estimate.\nSince there has been little change in basic rates, we have\n163"
