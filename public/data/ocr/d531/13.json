  "text": "men would be willing to serve on this policy making Board, An Operations\nBoard, composed of station and production center managers or program\ndirectors, would determine, within the policies set by the Board of\nTrustees, the program operation of the network. Under the direction of\nthis Board an Executive Director and such other employees as are needed,\nincluding engineers, would operate the network.\nNo station would receive compensation for programs it provided the\nnetwork. No station, under any circumstances, could ever be forced to\nuse any program it did not wish to use.\nConclusion\nTelevision channels, both for broadcast and micro-wave purposes,\nare a rapidly vanishing national asset. The channels to build a six-\nstate network for education are available today. It would be a rash man\nindeed who would predict these channels would still be available five\nyears from today.\nThe establishment of a regional network in this area is practic¬\nable, economical and extremely desirable now. In, say, 1966 it may\nstill be extremely desirable. Indeed, with rising school population\nand the ever-increasing shortage of qualified teachers it may be even\nmore desirable then than now. But if channels are not reserved, sta¬\ntions activated and networks established, these channels may no longer\nbe available. In -which case, no amount of either tears or money will\nserve to repair the damage or retrieve the loss. Obviously, those of\nus deeply committed to providing the best of educational opportunity,\nnot only for our children but for our posterity, must be concerned\nwith the activation of a regional educational television network now."
