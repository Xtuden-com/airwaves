  "text": "At least one commercially operated station in the six-state\narea has indicated its desire to obtain, for release on a delayed\nbasis, the programs sent over the network. It stated that it\nwould be willing to compensate the network in the amount of\n$lÂ£,000 per annum for this privilege. It is obvious that if even\nten commercial stations within the six states were minded to take\na similar action network costs could be reduced substantially.\nIf thirty were to take such action (or only an average of five\nper state), almost the entire network costs would be underwritten."
