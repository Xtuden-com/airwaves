  "text": "is indicated by the popularity among teachers of a series\nwhich taught, in a unique way, basic rules of safety for first\ngraders. Third, and perhaps most important, is the use of\ntelevision lessons in schools far beyond the metropolitan area.\nLiterally thousands of county and rural schools vriiose size\nprevents their having extensive facilities, adequate numbers\nof teachers, and teachers qualified in special subject areas,\nlie within the coverage of present and proposed educational\ntelevision stations. Over and over reports were made of schools\n•whose only available science lessons, for example, were coming\nto them over television.\nBecause curriculum structure varies within the six states’\nschools, the question of coordinating curriculum for inter¬\nschool use naturally arises. Briefly, with the background of\nincreasing numbers of examples of one school system making use\nof television lessons organized by another school system, the\ngrowing recognition of the quality of teaching in basic subjects\nwhich can be brought about by television and the crucial needs\nin smaller schools, the cooperative coordination of television\ncurriculum within the six states was indicated to be no unmanage¬\nable problem. Indeed, in many areas where in-school programs\nare presented by one school system primarily for use in its own\nwidely dispersed classrooms, other schools are making regular\nuse of the programs as well. As one Iowa School curriculum\nspecialist said while discussing the idea of the regional\nnetwork, \"The problems of inter-change of in-school programs can\nbe readily solved”."
