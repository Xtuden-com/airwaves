Al¬\nthough telephone companies have extensive information available, their\nsystems are generally more complex and are engineered to provide a\nmuch higher degree of reliability due to the many diverse functions\nserved.\nThe following cost estimates cover power, insurance, depreciation\nand maintenance personnel for the 2 way primary system. Due to the\nindefinite status of the VHF channels involved in the secondary\nsystem, detailed study of the 1 way system cost has not been made.\nThe cost has only been estimated as a percentage of the 2 way system\ncost.\nThe power cost is computed directly by total power load at $.03\nper KWH. The insurance has been determined from recent bids on\ninsurance for equipment and tower installations similar to those used\nfor UHF translator systems and other microwave systems. The depreci¬\nation is based on a uniform 10 year rate for all equipment.\nThe number of maintenance personnel for the primary network has\nbeen established at 13 plus one supervisor. This is based on dividing\nthe system so each maintenance man will be responsible for approx¬\nimately nine microwave units at five sites. The maintenance personnel\nwill generally be located at intermediate sites rather than at the\nterminals, permitting the reduction in travel in the event of trouble.\nThrough the cooperation of the station engineers at the terminal sites\n123"
