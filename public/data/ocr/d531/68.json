  "text": "stations and greater numbers of programs are involved*\nParenthetically, and presently most crucial, the hours\nof network service which could be offered through resources\nnow available may be the only way in which sufficient initial\nprogramming could be scheduled in order to establish new Edu¬\ncational Television stations in some areas where they are most\nneeded.\nResponses revealed two general classifications of offer¬\nings as those which would be most welcome from a network. First,\nthe kind of program whose presentation could not be accomplished\nlocally because of a lack of resources and second, the kind of\nprogram which could be produced locally but, because of out¬\nstanding resources in another locality, would be more desirable\nthrough network interchange.\nThe first classification was discussed in general terms\nand there was a greater variety of \"desired” types of programs\nin the areas where local resources are limited. However, almost\nunanimous expression indicated a wish for certain kinds of\ncultural programs. Symphony, Drama, and Dance were given as\nexamples of general programs whose presentation would enhance\nthe offering of each local station but whose origination would\nbe limited to a few larger centers in the proposed network region.\nBrief note should be made that often the desire for a specific\nkind of program for which there \"were no local resources came\nas the result of learning that the particular resources were\navailable in another locality within the six states."
