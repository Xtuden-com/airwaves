At present there\nare available to broadcasters, new electronic tools which were\nnot in existence when educators first considered the desirability\nof linking stations by direct circuits.\nAn example of these tools is the magnetic television recorder\nwhich can be used to syndicate high quality programs at a reasonable\ncost. Since it is the nature of a great deal of educational mater¬\nial that it need not be transmitted to the public at identical\ntimes throughout a wide portion of the country, we must look for\na different justification for linking stations through transmission\ncircuits. In fact, diversity in the presentation time of exchange\nprograms actually works to the advantage of the station since it\npermits it to schedule local live programs more effectively when\nlittle or no time flexibility is possible because of local school\nschedules and other factors.\nThrough the use of a magnetic recorder, each station could\nrecord and store a complete course for use during the following\nterm. The cost of tapes for recording a complete course for later\nuse would undoubtedly be excessively high, thus requiring other\nmeans of distribution. It is estimated that each course recorded\nwould require 48 half-hour programs at a cost of approximately\n159"
