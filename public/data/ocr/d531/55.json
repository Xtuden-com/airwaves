  "text": "It should be noted here that the nationally-televised\n19£8 ^Continental Classroom” physics course -was offered for\ncredit by several non-denominational private colleges, three\nLutheran colleges, six: Catholic colleges, three state univer¬\nsities and six state teachers colleges within the region -\nproof, to say the least, of the institutional universality of\nPhysics. Another example of intercollegiate use of television\ncomes from one of the six states in which college credit for\ncertain television courses is offered by non-denominational\ninstitutions as well as colleges with Lutheran, Catholic,\nMethodist and Presbyterian backgrounds.\nThus, with literally thousands of classroom courses being\noffered students daily by colleges and universities in the six\nstates, with the experience gained from the l£U courses televised\nin the past to students and the general public, with 19 courses\nnow being presented, and with increasing faculty participation\nin the use of television, the problem will not be one of searching\nfor merely adequate representation of needed educational pro¬\ngrams. It will rather be one of determining which are the best\nof the many resources available for the subject matter in\ngreatest- demand.\nh9"
