ThereÂ¬\nfore, an intrinsic consideration of the entire project must be the\nactivation of as many existing reserved VHF channels as possible\non the main microwave loop and branch legs. In the six states\ncomprising this study, there are at present 10 VHF reservations,\nonly four of which are operating plus one UHF channel in operation\nat Madison, Wisconsin.\nWhile existing VHF educational reservations in this region\ncan satisfy the requirements for an interconnected microwave system,\nmore VHF channels are needed to give each state local coverage over\nthe greater part of its population. Additional VHF channels could\nbe obtained in some areas by requesting that presently allocated\nVHF commercial channels be reserved for educational use. In some\nareas, new VHF channels could be added and reserved for educational\nuse while maintaining proper channel separation. Information on\nsuch additional channels will be discussed on a channel by channel\nbasis for each state.\nBy the addition of VHF channels to three of the states in the\nregion, we have provided each state with its own group of stations\nwhich can be used as a separate state network. By making use of\nthe dual service of the primary microwave network and the secondary\nservice, this system can provide each state with its own network.\nIn addition to the availability of its own network, each state can\nsimultaneously participate in receiving or originating programs"
