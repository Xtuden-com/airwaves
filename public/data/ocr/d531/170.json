  "text": "used the rates quoted in Mr. Craswell’s 1952 letter to determine a\ntotal system monthly charge.\nBi-directional program service between St. Paul-Minneapolis\nand Duluth, based on the existing AT&T formula, would cost in excess\nof $15,420.00 per month. The video service period is as outlined in\nMr. Craswell*s letter—Section 8.2.1 (i.e. any 8 consecutive hours\nper day, 7 days per week).\nSince the Twin Cities-Duluth leg represents approximately\n8% of the primary network system being studied herein, the complete\nsystem would incur an estimated monthly charge of $193,000 or an\nannual charge of $2,300,000.00 if obtained through existing AT&T\ncarrier services.\nWhile the AT&T approach would provide the ultimate in\nquality and reliability, there remains the fact that many commercial\nbroadcasters have still seen fit to reduce their network costs by\nconstructing their own intercity systems, as observed in the field\nreport shown in Section 2.4.\nThe figure of $193,000.00 per month referred to previously\ncovers simultaneous two way circuits into all points. Since some\nstations are not likely points of origination, this figure might be\nsomewhat reduced.\nFurthermore, the high dependability which AT&T service\nprovides does not require that duplicate circuits be provided as\nthey are in the case of the private network under study. Therefore,\nthe full burden for double cost in the AT&T estimate must be charged\nagainst multi-point origination and the flexibility of the two way\n16U"
