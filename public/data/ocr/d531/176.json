Such interconnection 7/ould have the follow¬\ning educational results;\na. The provision, by television, of first-class basic\neducational programs, at both the in-school and adult\nlevels, to areas presently 7/ithout opportunity to re¬\nceive such programs•\nb. The provision, by television, to the entire area,\nof the contributions of great teachers now available in\nonly a few educational centers.\nc. The economy of network operation. The five sta¬\ntions no7r operating separately, but producing about\n120 hours per week of educational programs could double,\ntriple or quadruple their program services if they\ncould use each other's best programs, particularly in\ncontent areas in which others have less distinguished\nor less adequate personnel or other advantages. Such\nan expansion of program schedules would become possible\nat only a fraction of the cost of producing an equiv¬\nalent number of programs in their 07m studios (if that\nwere possible at all, regardless of expense).\nd. The resources of six states and of a Targe number\nof stations could be combined to give better quality\nprograms•\n169"
