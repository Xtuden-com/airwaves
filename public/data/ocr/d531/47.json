Introduction.\nReconsideration of the preceding sections which have dis¬\ncussed the Educational Television experience in the Upper Mid¬\nwest Area will recall that Educational Television programs\ntraditionally fall into three general classifications:\n1) Systematic Adult Instruction for students of higher\neducation.\n2) Programs for students in the public and non-public\nschools. (In-School Programs)\n3) General Programs not included in' the above two cate¬\ngories •\nThese program types have a strong relationship with the\nthree main classifications of program resources most desirable\nfor educational television programming*\nAlthough some degree of interchange between classifications\nis common, it is construed that program resources may be cate¬\ngorized for purposes of this report in the following manner:\n1) Resources from institutions of higher learning.\n2) Resources from the public and non-public schools.\n3) Community resources and those which are not found in\neither of the above.\nTo a high, but certainly not mutually exclusive degree,\nprograms for students of higher education are found in the in¬\nstitutions of higher education. Similarly, programs used in the\nschool classrooms from kindergarten through the twelfth grade\nalmost always find their best source in the various schools of\nthat level, and a high proportion of the general programs of\na non-systematic nature may be found not only in both but par¬\nticularly in the varied and rich resources of the many communities.\nhi"
