The development of a series of lessons\nto constitute a course must be guided by the factors of the\nteaching-learning process, the principles of educational\ncommunication, and the demonstrated rate of achievement of the\nstudents.\nBecause of this, it naturally follows that the effectiveness of\ninstructional procedures must be constantly evaluated and must\nbe modified as may be required in much the same manner as the\nover-all curriculum.\nTESTING\nThis brings up the matter of testing in the cooperative television\ninstruction program. By testing, we usually mean some scheme of\ndetermining the specific achievement of a student during any\ngiven period or a device for measuring the retention by a student\nof specific learnings. No precise or foolproof ways have yet been\ndevised to accomplish these objectives. Certainly most of the\ntraditional methods of testing for learning have been less than\nsatisfactory. In spite of this, it is important that some degree\nof measurement be applied to both the ability and the inclination\nof the student to learn. But such a device should be primarily\na measurement of the teachers' ability and success in motivating\nthe student and guiding him to learning.\n12"
