It is only by complete co¬\noperation that a cooperative program of planning and teaching\ncan be successful.\nSUBJECTS TAUGHT BY TELEVISION\nThere has been some question as to what subjects would be taught\nby television. The ultimate penetration of the system of co¬\noperative instruction by television into the curriculum cannot\nbe precisely anticipated at this time. However, in the beginning\nof this system provisions will be made for the teaching of all\nbasic subject matter at all grade levels.\nThe science laboratory areas in the new secondary schools at\nLeone and Manua, and in the modification of the school at Utulei,\nare being constructed with special four-student laboratory tables,\neach of which will be equipped with its own television receiver\nfor basic laboratory demonstration and instruction. The problem\nhere will be one of supervision and of discipline.\nIn business education, typing, shorthand, bookkeeping, filing, etc.\nwill be taught by television and can be so arranged in classes that\nlarge groups can be taught as easily as small groups. In all skill\nareas where \"doing\" is a more significant part of the learning pro¬\ncess, only the related technical and academic subjects will be\ntaught by television; and they will be taught in direct relation\nto the shop experiences.\n8"
