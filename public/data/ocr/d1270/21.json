Its\nrecord throughout the years speaks for itself. Today, UCAL devotes a substan¬\ntial portion of its time to agricultural programs presented in conjunction\nwith local county agents and the University Farm Extension Service (R. 6096 -\n6097). Over its facilities are heard the nationally famous choir and other\nmusical organizations of St. Olaf College, and the musical groups of other\norganizations as they participate in the annual Musical Festival at St. Olaf\nCollege (R. 6097). From this station listeners may hear educational, religious,\nand other types of programs unavailable over any other station (R. 6097 - 6099).\nThe record contains innumerable illustrations of the unique program ser¬\nvices offered and proposed to be offered by Station KUOM, licensed to the\nUniversity of Minnesota (R. 6066 - 6074); Station K0AG-, authorized to Oklahoma\nA and M. College (R. 6079 - 6087); Station UNYC, licensed to the City of Hew York\n(R, 6101 - 6111); Station UMAD, licensed to the University of^Oklahoma, (R. 6114-\n6118); and each of the other NA33 stations scattered throughout the United\nStates.\nHowever, bccau.se of the limited time that these stations are now permitted\nto operate, the listeners in their respective service arehs are deprived of\nthis unique program service at nighttime. The record in this proceeding of¬\nfers a large nnmber of instances in which these stations cannot broadcast"
