This was granted,.\nSubsequently I learned from the chairman of the local ministerial council, that\nthis group, the International Council of Churches, spent much of its effort in\ntrying to tear down the Federal Council of Churches whom they rail at as being\nCommunistic, and secondly that their Amsterdam meeting was called on the spur\nof the moment and met two days ahead of the formal and well-known meeting of\nthe World Council of Churches, which was so well reported by NBC, CBS, etc.\nTheir approach, their letterhead, etc,, all tend to imply that T FEIR meeting was\nthe bonafide meeting, and that the World Council represented by the Federal\nCouncil from the U,S, and planned ahead for several years and representing most\nof the major church groups was the \"fly-by-nite.” '\"any stations have d>ittenu\non this lure, because nearly everyone assumes these are the true Amsterdam\nrepresentatives *\nOn learning that they night want to spend any and all program time in attacking\nthe Federal Council as \"Communistic\" I checked with the American Council\nSecretary in Iowa who finally admitted such was thcur intention; whereupon I\ntold him unless he changed his mind he had better stay home* Then ensued one\nof these \"free speech\" arguments, which was finally resolved by letting them\nappear, not in an address but in an interview where their statements could be\nchallenged.\nThis group is well-financed, vigorous, and fanatic. It would be well for any\nprogram director to double-check any representative they may send around to\navoid subsequent trouble from either permission to broadcast or denial,."
