The furore occasioned by the\naudible version of the Sharkey-Schmel-\ning bout was the first bombshell to\nburst. Second, the old argument as to\nwhether broadcasting sporting events\nhas a helpful or harmful effect on at¬\ntendance at games is on with renewed\nvigor following the announcement made\nby the major Eastern colleges that\nbroadcasters will not be permitted to re¬\nport their football games this coming\nfall.\nIn a recent article, Bill Cunningham,\nnoted sports columnist of the Boston\nPost, launched into an unbiased discus¬\nsion on the subject. He recognized the\nadvantages of the Yankee Network\npolicy of having specialized announcers\nfor each branch of sport, as is brought\nout in the following paragraph taken\nfrom his article:\n\"We’re radio wise and radio proud\nin this town (Boston), but we are a\ngleaming exception. We are an excep¬\ntion because we have capable men be¬\nhind the mikes in our parks and arenas.\nHoey on baseball, Ryan on hockey, Har¬\nrison on wrestling, and Gilroy on foot¬\nball do a capable, forthright, and in¬\nformative job. Our promoters, Messrs.\nQuinn and Fuchs, Charles Adams, and\nP. Bunyan Bowser, are broadminded on\nthe matter of radio reporting and the\nresult has. been a happy one for the\nradio fans. But this town is a major\nexception.”\nThat broadcasting has been a leading\nfactor in the sporting boom which has\nbeen under way for the last few years\nhas been the experience of the Yankee\nNetwork and officials of sport in Bos¬\nton. Stations WNAC and WAAB, Bos¬\nton key stations of the Yankee Net¬\nwork, have come to be known as the\nleading sports broadcasting stations in\nNew England. In addition to the\nwrestling bouts and the baseball, hockey,\nand football games, the Yankee Net¬\nwork has brought to its New. England\nlisteners many other events, including\nthe recent Eastern Olympic track and\nfield tryouts at Harvard Stadium, the\nRockingham motor speedway races at\nSalem, New Hampshire, and the New\nEngland intercollegiate track meet from\nBrown University in Providence.\nWhen John Shepard, 3rd, president\nof the Yankee Network, issued the\nBy John A. Neagle\nultimatum that no major sporting event\nin New England should be neglected in\nthe broadcasting schedule of that net¬\nwork, he also decreed that each event\nmust be broadcast only by a recognized\nauthority in the respective sport.\nThe latter order established a prece¬\ndent in broadcasting which even the\nnational chains have overlooked or\nfailed to appreciate as an important\nfactor in presenting word pictures of\nthe major athletic events to a critical\naudience of fans.\nToday the Yankee Network has a\nstaff of sporting announcers second to\nnone in the country, covering practically\nevery field of sports, and comprising\nFred Hoey, Yankee Network baseball\nannouncer\nthe following personnel: baseball, Fred\nHoey; football, Ralph Gilroy; wrestling\nand boxing, Gerry Harrison.\nFred Hoey, who has been drawing\nword pictures of the major league\ngames for the past six seasons and\nbroadcasting them to countless thou¬\nsands of baseball fans all over New\nEngland, claims a record for the num¬\nber of hours he has been on the air.\nIn the past six years he estimates a total\nof over two thousand hours of broad¬\ncasting.\nEvery fan in New England knows\nthe voice of Fred Hoey, and they all\nthoroughly enjoy his broadcasting which\nhas won him thousands of letters of\ncommendation from men and women in\nevery walk of life. With his long ex¬\nperience in baseball—first a ^mi-pro\nplayer, then as a writer of the game for\nBoston newspapers, and later as official\nscorer for the Braves, ten trips to the\nsouthern training camps and subse¬\nquently a reporter of the air—he num¬\nbers every major league player among\nhis friends.\nRalph Gilroy has gained equal popu¬\nlarity with his large audience of foot¬\nball fans. Gilroy, like the other Yankee\nNetwork announcers of sports, knows\nhis game. In 1922 he was captain and\nfullback of the championship Princeton\nfootball team. After college he coached\nfootball, played on Boston’s profes¬\nsional football team, the Boston Bull¬\ndogs, and officiated at college games,\nbefore becoming a Yankee Network an¬\nnouncer.\nEight years ago Frank Ryan gave what\nis believed to be one of the first radio\ndescriptions of a hockey game. Since\nthat time he has broadcast more than\nsixty hockey games from the rink, and\ngiven the New England audience of\nhockey fans over one hundred and fifty\nrebroadcasts of games played outside of\nBoston.\nRyan, who was graduated from Har¬\nvard College in 1924, has been writing\nhockey and other sports for the Boston\nTraveler for eleven years, besides being\nsecretary to the Boston Bruins for the\npast six years.\nGerry Harrison specializes in wrest¬\nling and boxing broadcasts, and assists\nGilroy in his football broadcasts. While\nstill a schoolboy, \"Spider” Kelly was his\nboxing instructor, and his training in\nwrestling began at the age of twelve\nwhen he was a pupil of \"Professor”\nHerman of Philadelphia, who even to¬\nday imparts knowledge to such wrestlers\nas Jim Browning, Dick Shikat, and Jim\nLondos. Harrison has broadcast all the\nmajor wrestling shows in Boston dur¬\ning the world’s championship reign of\nGus Sonnenberg, Ed Don George, and\nHenri Deglane. Many of the most\nspectacular boxing bouts have found\nHarrison behind the mike at the ring¬\nside, and for the past six years he has\nbroadcast all the New England and Na¬\ntional A. A. U. bouts held in Boston.\nHe is a member of the board of gov¬\nernors of the New England Association\nof A. A. U.\nBroadcasting builds up a great inter¬\nest in baseball, football, boxing, and\nany other games reported over, ±he air,\nand it is only natural with conditions\nas they have been since 1930 that at¬\ntendance marks should suffer all along\nthe line—radio or no radio."
