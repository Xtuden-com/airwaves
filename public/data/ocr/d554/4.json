Wood\nIrvin Stewart, Director January 28, 1939\nMr. Frank Schooley\nRadio Station WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Schooley:\nSince my letter to you of October 14, 1938,\ninquiring as to your report on recording equipment, this Committee\nhas decided to issue a report on sound recording equipment for\nschools. Our interest is not in recording equipment for broadcast\nstations but in equipment for use in classrooms. We expect the\nreport to consider the advantages and disadvantages of film, magnetic\ntape and disc recording systems and, with respect to disc, to\ncontain definite information designed to assist schools in selecting\nequipment suited to their needs.\nI shall appreciate it if you will let me know to\nwhat extent your report on sound recording equipment will cover\nthis field, as we have no desire to duplicate anything you are doing.\nI should also like to get your suggestions as\nto individuals whom you consider as competent to prepare such a\nreport. Obviously, the reporter must not only be technically comÂ¬\npetent, but he must have no connection or bias which would tend\nto invalidate his conclusions.\nPerhaps I should add that this Committee is\nentirely supported by Carnegie Corporation of New York.\nSincerely yours,\nIrvin Stewart,\nis/gq Director"
