Schooley\nRadio Station WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Schooley:\nI suspect that Mr. Ebel*s comment about\nthe general attitude of teachers toward electronic devices\nis only too well justified, and I must admit I do not know\nwhat can be done about it. Perhaps something eventually\nwill be done at teacher training institutions, but that\nwill have to await an awakening by those institutions to\nthe possibilities of auditory and visual aids. Meantime,\nwe can only hope that while a large part of the seed will\nbe thrown upon barren ground enough of it will land in\nfertile soil to justify the sowers* efforts.\nSincerely yours.\nIrvin Stewart,\nDirector\nIS/gq"
