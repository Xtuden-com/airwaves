  "text": "November 7, 1939\nDr. Irvin Stewart, Direotor\nCommittee on Scientific Aids to Learning\nNew York City\nDear Doctor Stewart:\nThis is with regard to the Confidential preliminary report\non SOUND RECORDING EQUIPMENT FOR SCJHooIS, Copy No. 17.\nAs in the case of other technical reports, I have asked our\nchief engineer to study the report. Comments are those of\nMr. A. James Ebel, Chief Engineer, WILL.\nOn the whole Mr. Ebel believes the authors did a good job\nof surveying the field of sound recording. He thinks, however,\nthere should be a follow-up report such as the one prepared\non receivers by Mr. John V. L. Hogan, vvhioh would give definite\nstandards or specifications for recording equipment to be used\nin the schools. A report of what a good recording machine\nSHOULD DO is desirable, more so than what present models actually\ndo.\nPage 1 - INTRODUCTION - Mr. Ebel believes that the section on\nTHE NOVELTY OF ONE»S OWN VOICE belongs in an appendix and not\nin the main text.\nPage 3 - line 21 - suggestion that word, \"true” be inserted, to\nread: “A true recording provides each member etc.”\nPage 10 - lines 27 and 28. Ebel believes (and I conour) that\nrecording is not a matter of luck. Furthermore on tests which\nwe have run we have found that we can record more frequencies\nthat the pick-ups head will reproduce. Therefore, the statement\nMas muoh ofM is an under-atateraent.\nPage 15 - lines 18-26 - very good.\nPage 16 - line 2 refers to head which will out aluminum or\nacetate. We feel that this is not a necessary requisite of a\ngood cutting head."
