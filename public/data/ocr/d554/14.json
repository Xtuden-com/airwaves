James Ebel, the chief engineer of W I L L,\nreviewed your publication “Broadcast Receiver,, and Phonographs\nfor Classroon Use”. After reading your bulletin, he handed\nme a note regarding it and also a comment on the possibility\nof its use by the teaching profession. Fox* some tl*ae I have\nhad this note on my desk, wondering what to do with it, but\nat the same time I felt Chat it should not be tossed In the\nwaste basket, so I am taking the liberty of sending it to you.\nThe note reads as follows:\nMI think that this report, along with the standard\nreports which you have, comprise a store of Information\nwhich is invaluable to the teaching profession. The\nreports throughout show oareful preparation, with\nspecial attention to technical accuracy without\nsacrificing simplicity and olarity.\nI still feel,however, that much of this work will be\nwasted effort until teachers are taught to realize\nthe value of such Information and not to shy away from\nit because it has a tinge of technicality. As an\nexample, when I explained the operation of the new\nreceiver-phono setup at Uni High to all the teachers,\ncnly one or two even attempted to follow the discussion.\nThe general attitude was, fWhy should I know anything\nmore than how to turn it on?* I believe that a survey\nstudy of electronic devices as applied to the teaching\nprofession should be required of all prospective teacher*\nA.J.E.M\nI wonder if this is a general condition, and if so, what if\nanything can be done about it?\nCordially yours.\nFES/rep\nFrank E. Schooley"
