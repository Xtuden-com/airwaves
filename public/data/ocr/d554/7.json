  "text": "October 2, 1939\nDr. Irvin Stewart,Director\nCommittee on Scientific Aida to Learning,\n41 East 42nd Street,\nHew York, N.Y.\nDear Dr. Stewart:\nIn response to your letter of September\n25 regarding \"Central Sound Systems for Schools\", I\nam sending you some commenta,mainly those of Mr. A.\nJames Ebel, Chief Engineer of WILL.\nOn page 11 Ebel raises the question reÂ¬\ngarding the use of symbols. He says that those used\nin your copy are not generally accepted as standard\nand the paper might be polished a bit by using standard\nsymbols.\nOn page 13, third paragraph, a suggestion\nis made that quality should be arbitrarily restricted.\nThis has been a long established \"gripe\" of the WILL\nstaff. Why try to perfect mechanical systems and then\nprovide manual controls to give Inferior quality. It\nis the time warn conflict between high fidelity and tone\ncontrol. Radio manufacturers capitalize on these two\nqualities in the same receiving set and yet they are\ndiametrically opposed.\nOn page 14, 2a, a reference is made to 70db.\nIn this particular oase, the reference is to acoustical\ndb. Throughout the distinction should be made between\nthe acoustical and electrical db.\nOn page 17 the sentence referring to frequency\nrange of commercial records we believe to be a bit off oolor.\nEbel is of the opinion that the cycle should be 7500 rather\nthan 5,000. In our own oase we can prove it to be true.\nRegarding the sentence - lines 28 to 28, we again raise the\nquestion of why include such a statement.\nPage 20 - perhaps the text could be improved\nby referring specifically to curves whioh, later clarify the\ntext."
