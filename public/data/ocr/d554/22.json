Table 1 in\nthe rtData on Instantaneous Recording Machines*\nshows that the stability was .08 per cent of\nthose machines tested. This particular machine\nshowed the best results. However, this good\nrecord may have been a result of the motor or\nof the drive system or a combination of both.\nCordially yours.\nFES/rep\nFrank E. Schooley\nProgram Director"
