His\nprediction may have been in line with\nthe facts, for granting high power to a\nfew stations forces all others to install\nnew and more powerful equipment. It\nalso forces listeners to purchase better\nand more expensive receivers if they\nwish to hear any except the high-power\nstations. This wellknown commercial\ngame has somewhat the same effect as\nstarting the nations of the world on a\nrace to produce the largest and best\nnavy. Colleges and universities will be\nat a disadvantage in such a game so long\nas they are left unprotected on channels\nwhere they may be attacked at any time\nby powerful commercial interests. Twelve\nout oT thirteen commercial stations will\nlikely be crowded out of the air, too,\nand the trend is likely to be as predicted\nby the monopolist in the early days of\nbroadcasting, if his policies prevail.\nWhen such facts are pointed out to\nmembers of the Federal. Radio Commis¬\nsion, the majority take the attitude that\nthe radio laws compel them to consider\nall stations as being on the same basis,\nwhether they are operated for private\nprofit Qr as public institutions. This\ndoes not agree with the point of view of\nthe Congressmen who made the law. It\nrelates rather to other phases of the\nstrategy of the dominant radio group.\nEarly in the broadcasting era cases\nwere taken into the courts and decisions\nwere handed down which classified\nbroadcasting as interstate commerce on\nthe ground that radio waves could not\nbe stopped at state boundaries. That\nwas satisfactory to the commercial\nbroadcasters because one federal agency\nis easier to deal with than forty-eight\nstate agencies.\nSidestepping—The next step in the\nstrategy was to avoid the responsibilities\nof common carriers or public utilities.\nEfforts to do this have been successful so\nfar, and we have the anomaly of inter¬\nstate commerce with no common carriers\nto carry it, no regulation of broadcasting\nrates by any governmental agency, no\nradio highways in the broadcasting band\nreserved for education or other govern¬\nmental functions, and no power in the\nhands of any governmental agency to\nkeep even profanity, obscenity, and the\nadvertising of quack doctors and lot¬\nteries off the air unless the citizens them¬\nselves assume the responsibility for pro¬\ntesting and fighting the matter through\nthe courts. A commercial station outside\nyour state may blanket it with objection¬\nable advertising while the Federal Radio\nCommission, which keeps the station on\nthe air, denies the state itself the right to\noperate a station for the benefit of its citi¬\nzens. Even telephone lines used in broad¬\ncasting, though they may be entirely\nwithin one state, are free from govern¬\nmental regulation in most, if not all,\nstates. Last year it was reported au¬\nthoritatively that the Ohio School of\nthe Air, conducted by the State Depart¬\nment of Education, was obliged to pay\nfor a telephone circuit for broadcasting,\nfive times what it would cost to use the\nsame circuit for the same length of time\nfor person-to-person communication, and\nthat the Public Utilities Commission was\npowerless to go into the matter to deter¬\nmine whether the charge was just and\nreasonable.\nCommission helpless?—The Fed¬\neral Radio Commission maintains that\nits hands are tied by the law so that it\nis powerless to protect broadcasting sta¬\ntions owned by states or by institutions\nchartered by states. It maintains that if a\ncommercial concern applies for facilities\nused by a state educational station, and\ninsists on a hearing, the hearing must be\ngranted and, regardless of expense, the\nstate station must appear as a respondent\nif it wishes to protect its rights. No matter\nhow many times it may be attacked in\nthe course of a year, the state station,\nsupported by tax money and operated\nfor public benefit, must bear the expense\nof employing attorneys and sending wit¬\nnesses to hearings in Washington. In\nFebruary, 1931, applications of com¬\nmercial broadcasters who wished to use\nradio channels for their own profit in¬\nvolved the rights of twenty-eight educa¬\ntional stations, about half the total num¬\nber of such stations still on the air. In\nMarch, twenty-seven educational sta¬\ntions were affected by similar applica¬\ntions.\nProtesting it is deeply interested in\neducation, and that its hands are tied\nso it cannot protect educational stations,\nthe Commission nevertheless objects to\nan appeal to Congress for reservation of\nchannels for education. Two members\nhave branded the bill, introduced by\nSenator Fess, for reserving a portion of\nthe radio channels for educational pur¬\nposes, as class legislation. If it is class\nlegislation, the laws establishing the\npublic schools are class legislation.\n[93]\nThe one alternative suggestion emanat¬\ning from the Commission is the same\nurged by commercial broadcasters;\nnamely, that commercial stations shall\nbe required to give a certain amount of\ntime each day to educational programs\nin return for privileges granted. When\nasked who would determine what hours\nshould be given to education, a member\nof the Commission who has been most\nactive in arguing for this arrangement\nsaid: “Well, of course, commercial sta¬\ntions would have to have the hours they\ncould sell to advertisers.” In short, com¬\nmercial broadcasters and the majority of\nthe Commission deny the legal right of\nthe states, responsible for public educa¬\ntion, to have any control of any broad¬\ncasting channels, and advocate that edu¬\ncation by radio be given in hours which\nhave no value for the commercial broad¬\ncaster and advertiser.\nSuch an arrangement has more disad¬\nvantages than that of inconvenience and\ninefficiency. It would make commercial\nstations the exclusive radio outlet not\nonly for education but also for the ad¬\ndresses of the elected representatives of\nthe people. These stations have the right\nto grant or deny requests for time and,\nin granting them, to choose the time\nwhen they shall be broadcast. Also they\nhave the right of censorship. By putting\none speaker on at one hour and another\non at a less favorable hour the owner of\na station or a chain might swing public\nopinion during a crisis as might be de¬\nsired. Also he could associate any pub¬\nlic speaker with commercial advertising.\nA national chain associated the Lincoln\nDay address of the President of the\nUnited States with the advertising of a\ntobacco company, and, in spite of conse¬\nquent protests, associated his Red Cross\naddress three months later with the same\nadvertising.\nCamouflage—In trying to maintain\ntheir hold on the public air, commercial\nbroadcasters often try to raise a smoke\nscreen by criticizing college stations. The\nFederal Radio Commission has been be¬\nfogged at times by these criticisms. But\nwhy should the Commission, or a com¬\nmercial broadcaster whose object in life\nis to build up an audience which he can\nsell to advertisers, have anything to say\nabout what the state does in education\nexcept what they have a right to say as\nindividual taxpayers? What they say is\nusually highly inaccurate, as is proven\nby their own actions. In hearings before\nthe Federal Radio Commission, commer¬\ncial broadcasters declare nobody wants to\nbe educated by radio, and officials of the"
