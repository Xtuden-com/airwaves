During the year, the NAEB has been represent¬\ned on education's Ad-Hoc Committee on the Copyright Law Revision; it\nhas continued its representation on the Joint Council of Educational\nBroadcasters and this year took over secerat.ariat responsibilities for\nthe Council; the U.

As we embark upon\na new year with a strengthened Association, we anticipate an oppor¬\ntunity\" to extend these services not only to the members, but on\nbehalf of the members."
