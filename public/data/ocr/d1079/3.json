This results in over-broadcasting in the\nthickly settled areas and the scarcity of privileges in the less thickly settled\nareas of our country.\nThis basic limitation of the present system explains many things about whieh\nwe now protest and which we hope can be remedied or improved by the plan which we\nwill propose.\nLet me say again that anything that we say that seems to be criticism is\nof a friendly nature. We greatly appreciate the things that have been done and\nare being done in our present system.\nWe propose today a combination plan which we think will conserve the major\nadvantages of several systems. We propose a plan in which there shall parallel\nthe present private commercial system a government system* a government chain\nparalleling the present commercial chain. Notice I said \"paralleling;” in other\nwords, supplementing but not supplanting, not displacing, the present system;\nnot creating any undue interference with the present system; not jeopardizing the\ninvestments that have been made in the present system; but a government chain\nthat will give programs for public interest, that will be independent of the\nnecessities and limitations of producing income from advertising; a government\nsystem that shall select its programs solely from the standpoint of public neces¬\nsity and public welfare.\nThis combination plan, we believe, will give America the advantages of the\npresent private system and the advantages of the public system; where one system\ninevitably is limited and cramped, the other system may be strong; one will sup¬\nplement the other and the combination will be the best the world possesses in\nbroadcasting.\nThis system as we envision it would also stimulate the establishment and\noperation of local public broadcasting stations.
