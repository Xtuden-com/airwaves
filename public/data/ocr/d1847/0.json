MAY, 1966\n200 Attend\nNAEB Southern Meet\nRegistrants at the NAEB Region II\nSouthern Area conference in Memphis last\nmonth heard Tennessee Governor Frank\nClement speak of his personal commitment\nto ETV, saying that “. . . it is the best,\nthe cheapest, the most efficient—perhaps the\nonly solution to my state’s education prob¬\nlems.” He said he would not bemoan the\nlost opportunities of commercial television,\nbut that instead, “We must learn to make\nthe magic of Madison Avenue work for\nus.”\nGov. Clement keynoted the conference.\nThe banquet speaker was Robert L. Lin¬\ncoln, executive director, Council of Higher\nEducational Institutions, New York City.\nTalking on “Communications in the Six-\nties,” he said, “TV and radio must bring\nthe community to the home ... we must\ndetermine how best to use the air time.”\nIn addition to business sessions and other\ngeneral sessions on interconnection and leg¬\nislation, conferees could attend a number\nof special-interest sessions—on engineering,\nproduction, management, studio teaching,\nfacilities and equipment, graphics, promo¬\ntion, utilization, funding, research and de¬\nvelopment.\nThe group voted Jacksonville, Fla., as the\n1967 conference site1—and Atlanta, Ga., as\nthe site for every third year, beginning in\n1968.\nNAEB Improves\nPlacement Procedure\nThe NAEB has expanded its placement\nservice and will concentrate on fast and ef¬\nfective service to individuals and prospec¬\ntive employers. Changes in registration and\nrecord procedures and a mechanical sort¬\ning device are expected to speed processing.\nTo be known hereafter as the NAEB Per¬\nsonnel Service, it will function directly un¬\nder the NAEB president’s office, with Fred¬\nerick Breitenfeld, associate director of\nETS, overseeing operations.\nETV Facilities Program\nReports Actions\nIn notices dated March 31 and April 5,\nHEW approved grants for five new ETV\nHoward D.

The\nnew station is Ch. 45, Chattanooga, with a\ntotal estimated project cost of $537,663. Ex¬\npansions and estimated total costs are:\nWMVS, Milwaukee, $306,408; KWSC,\nWashington State University, $78,565;\nWEDH, Connecticut ETV Corporation,\n$246,115; KTWU, Washburn University of\nTopeka (Kan.), $33,796; WUNC, Univer¬\nsity of North Carolina, $314,979; and\nKLRN, Southwest Texas ETV Council,\n$360,000.\nNAEB Testifies Before\nMorse Committee\nNAEB President William G. Harley\ntestified before Senator Morse’s Education\nSubcommittee on April 5, to support an\nAdult Education Association’s suggested\namendment to the Adult Education Act of\n1966. The proposal is to add a title to the\nAct “to create bold new approaches to\nadult basic education,” including ETV.\nHarley supported the AEA recommenda¬\ntion, but urged that radio be included as\nwell, saying “Radio can do many education¬\nal tasks as well as TV and more economi¬\ncally.”\nNAEB Petitions FCC\nTo Reconsider\n5 th Report and Order\nIn a petition filed March 21, the NAEB\nurges the FCC to reconsider its position re¬\ngarding reservation of educational channels\nand to adopt a Table responsive to the edu¬\ncator’s demonstrated needs and in tune with\nnational educational objectives. The NAEB\ncalls the Fifth Report wrong for all of the\nreasons that the Fourth Report was wrong\nThe Commission’s table erects artificial\nlimitations on the number of channels and\nhence automatically restricts the absolute\nnumber of available reserved assignments,\nsays the petition. While the FCC table re¬\nserves a third of the channels for educa¬\ntion, the limitations still allow only 615 for\neducation, out of 1756. The NAEB table\nalso reserves a third of the available chan¬\nnels—roughly 1100 out of 3200.\nNAEB’s petition also hits hard at the\nconflict between the FCC’s unsaturated\ntable and other Congressional education ob¬\njectives. NAEB_ names the recent specific\nacts in which Congress has explicitly rec¬\nognized ETV’s role in educatibn, and says\nthat the Commission’s refusal “to provide\nample, or even minimal, room for these de¬\nveloping educational uses . . . runs directly\ncounter to the purpose and goals of these\nCongressional enactments.”\nProfessional Interest\nSections Organize\nThe ranks of all NAEB Professional In¬\nterest Sections have grown since their for¬\nmation at the 1965 national convention in\nWashington. Some 300 Individual Members\nparticipated in the planning meetings of the\nsix sections at that time.\nEach section now has a national chair¬\nman ; four have regional representatives\nthroughout the country, and one other has\n1"
