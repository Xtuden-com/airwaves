In one corner was a TWX machine which occasionally spit\nout a news item, under the name of Consolidated Press, but that\ndoubtful service soon folded. Today, no one at KVOO even remem¬\nbers who operated that service, or what actually happened to it.\nIn those days, Ken shared a room in the old Wright building studios\nof KVOO, with C. A. O’Donovan, now treasurer of Southwestern Sales\nCorporation, owner and operator of KVOO. \"Donny\" and \"Ken” were\njust \"flunkies\" then. They worked all day and half the night at\na multitude of mundane jobs, in addition to their regular jobs...\nKen’s task of scraping up news for the air...and Donny’s task of\nkeeping the books straight and making sure that programs didn’t\nstay on the air two weeks after the advertiser cancelled.\nOthers operated In that basement room under the sidewalk of West\nThird Street, too...some four-footed gray characters who were\nsometimes brazen enough to scurry right out on the desk and snatch\na midnight sandwich from the news editor."
