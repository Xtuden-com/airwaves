All these programs are sparked with actual tape recordings\nof the sounds and the voices that make the stories. All are recor¬\nded personally by Ken.\n\"Assignment Southwest\" was born five years ago as a weekly show,\nand at the time, the \"big boss\" at' KVOO was sure Ken couldn’t\npossibly find enough material for such a program. Today. • .500\nstories later...and with the show stepped up to a twice-weekly\nschedule...Ken’s file of story possibilities contains more than\n1,000 new stories, and from one to five new ones are added each\nday.\nFor more than a year, Ken presented \"Voices of the 45th\" each\nSunday evening on KVOO...a recorded documentary report from the\nmen of Oklahoma’s 45th Infantry Division, now on duty on Hokkaido,\nJapan. This show began when the 45th was called into Federal Ser¬\nvice in September of 1950...followed them through training at\nCamp Polk, Louisiana...and went with them when they embarked for\nJapan at the Port of New Orleans in March, 1951. All programs in\nthis country were made by Ken Personally. After the division reached\nJapan, tape recordings of the voices of the men were secured for\nKen by the 45th Division Public Information Office. In this way,\nthe show was continued for six months after the division reached\nJapan. This program was one of the most popular ever aired on\nKVOO, bringing a tremendous volume of mail from friends and fami¬\nlies of more than 8,000 Oklahoma men in the 45th."
