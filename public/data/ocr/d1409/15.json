The sets were rolled\nfrom room to room as needed* The classroom receivers were not equipped with 300 to\n72 ohm matching transformers; instead the 72 ohm line was connected through the\noutlet boxes to the receivers. It was found by experimentation with various match¬\ning transformers that their use caused too great a loss of signal strength. The\nreception on Channel 9 was better without the transformer; however there was no\nnoticeable change in reception on Channel 1* or 3 with or without the transformer.\nAs a result they were not used.\nRooms connected in parallel were not necessarily on the same floor, some lines\nhad a room on each of three floors. As many as three receivers were operated in\nparallel and in different combinations with no interference and equal picture qual¬\nity in each room. This is not in accord with theory; however the antenna and dis¬\ntribution system provide good interference free reception with equal picture qual¬\nity in each room.\nThe cost of the material used in the systems was as follows:\n12-room building $ 7£.00\n19-room building 12£.00\nThe installation was made by the author with the cooperation of a local television\ndealer, who provided technical information and materials at a special school dis¬\ncount.\nThe above antenna and distribution system may not be suitable for use in all\ninstances; however in St. Louis it has been found to give very good performance\nat a cost within reach of most school budgets.\n^Director, Audio-Visual Department\nFerguson-Florissant School District\nSt. Louis County, Missouri\nMay 3, 1955"
