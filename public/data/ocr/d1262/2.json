The first, “Ten Years Old and Twice\nas Bright,” featured a concert and inter¬\nviews following a prededication dinner at¬\ntended by area business, social and civic\nleaders. The second was the telecast of the\ndedication ceremonies.\n^ WFBE, Flint, Michigan, has announced\nthat many copies of its News of the Week\nprogram have been requested following the\noffer in the NAEB Journal [July-August,\n1965, page 22]. Commercial WJRT, Flint,\nhas given time weekly for the program to\nbe done on TV.\n^ WFBE broadcast the entire proceedings\nof the first regional Foreign Policy Confer¬\nence to be held in the Midwest. The con¬\nferences were held to introduce principal\nassistants to the Secretary of State to citi¬\nzens to outline our foreign policies and their\ngoals on a non-partisan basis, reviewing and\nevaluating the current international scene.\nThis conference was the fifth and final ses¬\nsion held in various parts of the country this\nyear.\n^ “Pullman Street Signs—How Not to\nGet There,” one program from Channel 10\nReports, Washington State University’s\nKWSC-TV community problems series,\nwas honored by being shown at the na¬\ntional meeting of the Radio and Television\nNews Directors’ Association.\n^ WOSU-TV, Ohio State University, was\nawarded an “Emmy” for the first time for\nits first three-hour documentary. The Co¬\nlumbus chapter of the Academy of Televi¬\nsion Arts and Sciences presented the award\nfor “Ohio Has Saved the Union.” The pro¬\ngram commemorated Ohio’s vital support of\nthe Civil War and the contribution made by\nOhioans, and was in production for one\nyear.\n^ WBUR, Boston University, recently de¬\nvoted two consecutive evenings to record¬\nings of the twelve pianists from five coun¬\ntries who won the competition at the Inter¬\nnational Piano Festival in Montreal. One\nprogram was devoted to the two musicians\nwho shared first place: Albert Lotto of the\nUnited States and Jean-Claude Pennetier\nof France.\n^ WBUR has a new series, Conference\nCall. It is a telephone program, new to edu¬\ncational radio, and will contact experts any¬\nwhere in the country. On the first pro¬\ngram, officials of the National Educational\nRadio Network and others concerned with\neducational broadcasting spoke.\n^ KRMA-TV, Denver, began a new, daily,\none-hour children’s program this fall.

S.\n—^ Public Health Service’s Medical Self-Help\nr training course. Following the broadcast,\nviewers may attend centers for practical\ninstruction on the information learned on\nthe telecast.\n—by\nAfter countless hours of preparation,\nafter thousands of feet of film footage, after\na TV series is finally completed—what\nthen? A University of Michigan Television\nCenter production is routed to some sixty\neducational and commercial stations from\ncoast to coast. But does it then come home\nto collect dust in the film library?\nThe American Negro, a documentary pro¬\nduced in 1964 in Ann Arbor, is enjoying\nprolonged usefulness because of its timely\ntopic and over-all standard of excellence.\nThe series looks in depth at the current\nNegro revolution and examines the history\nof the Negro, concentrating upon his prob¬\nlems, hopes, and fears. Nationally recog¬\nnized experts join educators and local citi¬\nzens in discussing such topics as the role of\nthe Negro in American history, the Negro\nchild’s search for identity, psychological\nbarriers to> integration, the civil rights move¬\nment, the Negro church, and problems in\nhousing, education, and employment.\nThe ten-program series was first televised\nover WWJ-TV, Detroit, on consecutive\nSundays at noon. Subsequently, the series\nwas aired on some thirty TV stations, and\nit is still being booked around the country,\nwith some channels requesting reruns.\nIn addition to television, the series has\nbeen rented for a nominal fee and used\naudiovisually by public schools in Des\nMoines, Iowa, and Evanston, Illinois, as well\nas a dozen schools throughout Michigan.\nThe St. Louis schools rented the series for\nin-service training of personnel involved in\na summer anti-poverty program in educa¬\ntion.\nThe University of Western, Australia\npurchased the entire series for use on TV\nas well as in classes, and several universi¬\nties—Connecticut, Syracuse, Michigan State,\nand Michigan—have reserved films for\nclasses and seminars.\nVarious civic groups have used the\nEllen Miller\nfilms: The League of Women Voters in\nseveral cities incorporated the films into\ntheir meetings on human resources; the Ann\nArbor Human Relations Commission intro¬\nduced a discussion series on civil rights and\nequal opportunity by presenting two of the\nfilms; and discussions were stimulated by\nthe film in a YWCA group and a child\nstudy club. Several church groups—in Chi¬\ncago, Detroit, Atlantic City—have used the\nfilms.\nTo encourage use of the series in group\ndiscussions, the TV Center made supple¬\nmental material available; it supplied syn¬\nopses of the individual programs and recom¬\nmendations for related readings to all who\nrequested them. Recently, the University of\nMichigan Extension Service prepared a list\nof questions to be used by discussion lead¬\ners.\nFuture implications for the series are ex¬\nciting to contemplate. According to Alfred\nSlote, the writer-producer, The American\nNegro has generated interest in production\nof a Negro history series aimed at pre¬\nschool and school-age children. Project\nHead-Start, the Office of Economic Op¬\nportunity program aimed at pre-school cul¬\nturally disadvantaged children, and other\nsimilar anti-poverty projects might wish to\nuse the films in their orientation plans for\nteachers and aides. Settlement houses, social\nagencies, and sociology classes seem likely\naudiences.\nAnd so it seems unlikely that this docu¬\nmentary will soon retire into the archives\nto gather dust.\n• The photograph shows Series Host Al¬\nvin Loving, University of Michigan pro¬\nfessor of education (left), and Mel Ravitz,\nDetroit City Councilman and professor of\nsociology at Wayne State University, on\ncamera for the eighth program in the se¬\nries, “Where Shall We Live?”\nDECEMBER, 1965\n3"
