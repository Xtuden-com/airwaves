The trials rep¬\nresented the extermination of all intra-Party opposition. The\nroll call of the accused is like a Who’s Who of the old Party\nleadership. The accusations in the Zinoviev-Kamenev trial were\nlimited to charging the defendants with Kirov's assassination\nand plotting to assassinate other Party leaders. In the later\ntrials the net was cast wider: connivance with the exiled\nTrotsky, foreign powers, or both, was alleged. In the public\ntrials, these charges involved assertions of the existence of\nwhat seem to have been fantastic conspiracies and plots. Yet,\nmore astounding than these charges even, were the public confes¬\nsions. Only one man of this whole group denied his guilt. He\nwas that same Nicolai Krestinsky who, as we have heard, subordi¬\nnated the work of the courts to that of the Cheka in 1918 when\nhe was Commissar of Justice. In the preliminary investigation\nbefore the public trial Krestinksy admitted the charge that\nhe had established espionage connections with the German General\nVon Seeckt on the instructions of Trotsky. But at the trial:\nGET ECHO IN THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE\nAccused Bukharin, do you plead guilty to the charges brought\nagainst you?\nYes, I plead guilty to the charges brought against me.\nAccused Rykov, do you plead guilty to the charges brought\nagainst you?"
