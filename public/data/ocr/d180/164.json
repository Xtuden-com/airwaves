And land for the rice to take root in. Above\nall - the land beneath them! (LAUGHS) Epigram, eh?\nAnyhow - give us your science, your basic grass-roots\nskills first. Send us people to teach their use.\nLike our own County agents in America.\nWeTll go on from there. We want help, yes - but not\ncharity. Help us to help ourselves. And such help\nincludes moral support, patience, understanding. In\nthe help we wish and need, these are priceless ingredients\nThese are the carbon and the manganese that makes the\nsteel tough and hard. (PAUSE: HQSFITALLY) I?m thirsty,\nwould you like a nice cold drink?\nOokay!\nIN AND UNDER\nYou sip a cold drink.
