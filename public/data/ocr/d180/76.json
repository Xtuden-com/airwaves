  "text": "-38-\nFAINSOD: Were there criminals in the camp?\nGLIKSMAN: This is one of the worst features of our camp—the professional\ncriminals. They are in a minority in the camp and they are\nthe real bosses of the camp. They are privileged, they are\nconsidered the most reliable, most trustworthy by the admin¬\nistration. They occupy all posts that the administration\ngives to prisoners—almost all such posts are occupied by those\nhardened criminals. Even the administration was frightened\na little of them and they used to take advantage of their privi¬\nleged position, and many many sufferings are posed not by the\nadministration—but the criminal prisoners with whom we had\nto live day and night together.\nNARR: And now, Dr., may I ask one final question of Mr. Gliksman.\nMr. Gliksman, how did you obtain your release from the camp?\nGLIKSMAN: I got my release before my sentence was over. Russian politi¬\ncal prisoners very seldom get released even if their sentence\nis up. The camp authorities have no right to release a pris¬\noner even if his file shows that his sentence was up. And some¬\ntimes an order for the extension of the camp term would come\nfor another five, eight, or ten years. The purpose of releas¬\ning the Polish prisoners was to organize a Polish army against\nthe Germans, but this army did not fight on the Soviet front.\nAnd so we left for Persia, and then through Europe I came to\nthe United States after the war."
