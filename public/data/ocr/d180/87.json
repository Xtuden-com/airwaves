I think Shostakovich does\ndo a great deal of experimenting which I think is\npraiseworthy, and as far as the absence of Russian folk\nmusic is concerned it seems to me that the whole\ntendency of a criticism of this sort boils down to\n\"let's go back to Tschaikovsky.Apparently anything\nthat shows any signs of objective writing is\nobjectionable.\nThis is Mr. Cowell.\nYes, but don't you think that after all music grows\nthrough experiment and that people appreciate the\ngro\\-tfth ?\nOh, very definitely yes, but they are slow to appreciate\nit.\nWould you agree with that, Mr. Slonimsky?\nWell, I both agree and disagree. First of all I want to\npoint out that even at the time of the first performance\nof the Seventh Symphony there was some criticism of its\nmusical treatment in the Soviet Union, primarily because\nShostakovich seems to have been more successful with\nthe musical characteristics of the Nazi theme rather\nthan the Russian theme. Several musical critics, not\nunanimous, but some musical critics of the Soviet\nUnion asked this question: HHow come that Shostakovich\nis so much more successful in representing the enemy,\ntrue in a grotesque form, and failed to represent the\ngrandeur of the Russian people?\" This was one of the\nearly criticisms of the Seventh Symphony of Shostakovich\nin the Soviet Union."
