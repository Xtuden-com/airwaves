The kulaks were\n\"liquidated\"-this businesslike word, applied to human beings,\nhas taken on the grimmest connotations. Applied to the kulaks,\nit meant, in all cases, forcible ejection from their land.\nThose who physically resisted ran the risk of being shot, and\nsome were. But most were turned over to the OGPU and so became\nthat huge reservoir of labor which the prison-camp system ex¬\nploits. Indeed, so great was this huge captive labor force that\nsome of it was even farmed out to other Soviet enterprises which\ncould not obtain sufficient free labor. The OGPU thus became an\nindustrial empire as well as a security organization.\n(MUSIC:_ J/ERY FAINTLY NOW, JTHE_INTEfttJATIONALE)\nNARRATOR: The realities of government by dictatorship were making the\noutlines of the dream of freedom fainter and fainter.\nBut the iron control over a population a dictatorship can exer¬\ncise when necessary had not yet manifested itself completely.\nIn July, 1934-the OPGU became a Commissariat of the Soviet\ngovernment-the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs—\nthe NKVD. By this move, all police elements and all prisons\nwere united under a single authority. And then-\nA SINGLE REVERBERANT PISTOL SHOT. LET IT ECHO\nSOUND:"
