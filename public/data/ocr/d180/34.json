I will^play for you some pieces based\non natural folk song melodies which the Soviet regard\nas democratic music, that is as pro-people music, and\nthen melodies that are more artificial, that is modem\nmelodies which the Soviets regard as anti-people. Now\nI will illustrate the one kind, the pre-194# kind and\nthe post-194# kind. (PAUSE) Now here is a melody from\nShostakovich’s Cello Sonata which was written in 1934\nand which was regarded as following the popular idiom,\nthat is, the idiom understandable to the masses.\nPIANO^\nOn the other hand a prelude by Shostakovich written at\nabout the same time abounds in all kinds of strange\nturns,\nmelodic tunes--. Now this kind of composition was\nregarded as anti-democratic, anti-people.\n,PIANCW\nYou know , it seems to me that this ''mother-knows-best-*\nattitude of the Central Committee conveys the most utter\ncontempt for the musical intelligence of the masses.\nThese men, who tell a composer what to write, pretend\nto be of the masses. What they mean is - *'I am the\nmasses and I don’t like that piece. So I am going to\ncall it anti-people.,? After all if Beethoven and Bach\nand Brahms and Schumann and Mozart survived, the people\nwho have kept them alive have not been any Central\nCommittee nor any kind of music credit. It is because\nof the so-called masses that those composers live today—\nbecause people want to hear them. I have read somewhere\nthat that Union of Composers undertakes to tell a given\ncomposer in what form his next composition will be.\n-more-"
