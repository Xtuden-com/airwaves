I saw I tell you.\nGo on.\nThey were heating a square iron plate red hot. Then\ntwo soldiers brought up one of our young men - held\nhim fast. I saw a third soldier step behind him with\na great sword. The colonel gave the signal...\n(OFF) Runt\nThe swordsman swung - the man started running.......\nThe head fell. With tongs, the colonel pressed the hot\nplate to the stump. The headless man took one step\nand fell.\n(OFF) Cornel They can do better than that! Bring me the\ntall one!\nThe tall one did better.
