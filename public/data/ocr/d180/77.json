Mass deportations of the\nnative populations from the Baltic States and other border areas •\nof European Russia have been reported; the Soviet Press has\nalso, during this period, carried on campaigns against collec¬\ntive farm abuses, and noted cases of corruption in the bureauc¬\nracy and in industry. It has also carried accounts of purges\nin the Party and among intellectuals.

At the beginning of this program some\nidea of the pervasive influence of the secret police on Soviet\nlife was briefly sketched; Dr. Merle Fainsod of Harvard Uni¬\nversity, who will sum up for us the significance of the use\nof-Terror as a System of Power.
