In\nfact, this oppression of the censors has recently brought\nabout the development of an incredible theory—the\ntheory of the drama without conflict, as a consequence\nthere has appeared in the Soviet Union over the last\nfive years a quantity of plays filled with black and\nwhite, negative and positive characters and hopelessly\nstereotyped situations. So bad have been the results\nthat a kind of national scandal has arisen, and as a\ncorrective a prominent playwright, N« Virtu, has been\npermitted recently to expose in the public press the\nwhole vile business of the murder of dramatic art.\nHe writes:\nVOICE II: ''Everything living, true to life, sharp, fresh and\nunstereotyped has been combed out and smoothed out to\nthe point where it was no longer recognizable. Every\nbold, unstereotyped word in a play had to be defended\nat the cost of the playwright’s nerves and the play’s\nquality...\nThe future holds forth a great deal for the theaters and\nfor the Soviet audience if the creative energies of the\nwriters are free from the fetters forged in bureaucratic\nnooks and crannies by indifferent officials who preach\nthe idea of conflictless, 1 speak-softly, speak*gently,\nbe-pious’ writing1'\n'\n;V'r'"
