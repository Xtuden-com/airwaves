He looked at me sceptically\nand asked, \"Will people listen?\" I came back with another ques¬\ntion, \"Why won’t they listen?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"we have heard\nso many stories of concentration camp brutalities that our inter¬\nest has become dulled and our capacity for indignation exhausted.\nTerror has become commonplace.\"\nTerror HAS become commonplace. A third of the world’s popu¬\nlation lives in its shadow. If the men in the Kremlin have\ntheir way, there will be many others. If we are to prevent that\nfrom happening, we need to know how the Soviet secret police\noperates, how it developed, and where it appears to be going.\nThis program tells that story - in the authentic language of the\nhistorical record - without embroidery and without sensational¬\nism. The practitioners of terror speak in their own words; the\nvoices of the victims which you will hear come from official\ndocuments and the reports of living witnesses."
