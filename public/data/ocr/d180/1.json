One broad field of human\nendeavor in the Soviet Union of which little is known\non the outside is the field of culture and the manner\nin which the government controls it. In the early\ndays of the Soviet regime artists were permitted a\ngreat deal of freedom and often they created works of\nhigh artistic merit. However, with the swift growth\nof the power of Stalin and the domination of the\nCommunist Party he leads, regimentation in the arts,\nas in all human endeavors in the Soviet Union, grew\nrapidly. Since th-c end of the .\nand publicly asserted its absolute con^roi^bver all\nideological matters in a jiew<rlational and international\npolicy of far-reaching importance, a significant aspect\nof which is a declared hostility to the West and\n•Amu. In this new policy all Soviet art has been\nplaced under rigorous controls by the Party, with\ndevastating results which are now becoming apparent.\nHow these controls operate in the Soviet Union, and\nthe effect they have on the artist and his creations in\nliterature, drama, and music will be the subject of\nthis broadcast.\nIf only those blackfaces wouldn’t sit so close’. Right\nnext to me’. They shove with their elbows, laugh and\nanswer their lessons right out."
