In the United States symphony orchestras vied\nwith one another for the privilege of first performing\nthe composition here. Now let us hear a bit more of\nthis work, for I want our musical experts who are present\nwith us today in the studio to give us their reactions\nto this piece. There are here Mr. Deems Taylor, composer\nand well-known musical commentator; Mr. Henry Cowell,\nthe well-known American composer; and Mr. Nicolas\nSlonimsky, who is noted as an author of books and\narticles on music, and especially as an authority on\nRussian music.\nA_PORTIONJ)F THE FIRST M0J^MENT_OF SHOSTAKOVICHES^\nSEVENTH SWHONY_BETl.EEN_NO._55 AND N0^ 60_. FADE_BACK\nFOR: 1\nNow despite the praise of this symphony before the\nwar, since the musical resolution of the Central\nCommittee in 194$, these very passages you've heard,\nas well as much else of this Seventh Symphony, have\nbeen singled out by Soviet critics for their grotesque\nand dissonant qualities, for the formalistic trend of\nthe music, and the absence of folk themes. On the\nbasis of what you have just heard, do you think this\ncriticism justifiable? Mr. Deems Taylor."
