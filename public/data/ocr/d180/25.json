  "text": "-26-\nAUTHORITY II: i?The state of affairs is particularly bad in the case\nof symphonic and operatic music. The Central Committee\nhas here in mind those composers who persistently\nadhere to the formalist and anti-people school—a school\nwhich has found its fullest expression in the works of\ncomposers like Comrades Shostakovich, Prokofiev,\nKhachaturian, Shebalin, Popov, Miaskovsky and others.\nTheir works are marked by formalist perversions, anti¬\ndemocratic tendencies which are alien to the Soviet\npeople and their artistic tastes.\n,?Their music savors of the present-day modernist\nbourgeois music of England and America.'*\niMUSICi_UP FULL_TO BUTTON),\niMUSICj__OPENING_OF SHOSTAKOVICH^ S_vSEFENTH__SYMPHONY:__FADE BACK FORj.)\nSIMONS: This is Ernest Simmons again. What you have been\nlistening to is the opening of Shostakovich1s famous\nSeventh or Leningrad Symphony. It was first performed\nduring the war, on March 1, 1942, in the temporary\nSoviet capital of Kuibishev, and it was uniformly\nhailed then as his greatest work in the Soviet Union.\nIn the United States symphony orchestras vied with one\nanother for the privilege of first performing the\ncomposition here. Now let us hear a bit more of this\nwork, for I want our musical experts who.are present\nwith us today in the studio to give us their reactions\nto this piece. There are here Mr. Deems Taylor,\ncomposer and well-known musical commentator; Mr. Henry\nCowell, the well-known American composer; and Mr.\nNicolas Slonimsky, who is noted as an author of books\nand articles on music, and especially as an authority\non Russian music."
