It is confined\nto a definite tonality; it is more in the Russian\nfolksong tradition and therefore it was approved.\n_PIAN0J_\nNow sometimes Prokofiev wrote tunes that are very\ndefinite in its rhythm but are somewhat uncertain in\nits tonality. In this case he was half praised, half\ndamned.\n_PIANOS\nThis is a theme from his march ‘'March for Band\"' written\nabout 1940.\nYou know, it seems to me that this \"mother -knows-best'7\nattitude of the Central Committee conveys the most utter\ncontempt for the musical intelligence of the masses.\nThese men, who tell a composer what to write, pretend\nto be of the masses. What they mean is - \"I am the\nmasses and I donft like that piece. So I am going to\ncall it anti-people.'7 After all if Beethoven and Bach\nand Brahms and Schumann and Mozart survived, the people\nwho have kept them alive have not been any Central\nCommittee nor any kind of music credit. It is because\nof the so-called masses that those composers live today—\nbecause people want to hear them.\nIsn't it also true, Mr. Taylor, that the masses of\npeople have been increasingly delighted by the very\nmusic which has at first received a great deal of\ncriticism for the very element of modernity and\ndissonance, don't you believe?"
