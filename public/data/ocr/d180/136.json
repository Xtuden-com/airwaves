Now exhale.\nEXHALES\nHave you been overworking, Comrade Director?\nWork? We never stop, day and night. We’re pushing\nto meet the plan. Very serious situation. This is the\nlast month. Every machine..every man is needed.\nI am aware of the factory’s production problems. I\nwas reprimanded by the District Health Committee on\nthis matter three months ago.\nI’m sorry about that. Some people are awfully blunt,\nyou know. I’m sure that if someone had only come to\nyou and said, ‘’Doctor Konevskaya, we are faced with a\nserious problem in meeting the plan. We need every\nworker.i? Then nothing further would’ve been necessary.\nAfter all, we’re both administrators, you have the\nclinic, I have the factory, we understand these problems.\nI take it you are suggesting we postpone treatment.\nLet us say that we should reserve judgment in certain\ncases.\nUntil\"\nThe plan is met.\nBut what if the worker is really sick? Then the\nillness may become aggravated. The worker instead of\nspending two days at home, winds up in the hospital\nfor two or three weeks. '’Reserving judgmentin such\ncases works against production and is a great\ndisservice to the state."
