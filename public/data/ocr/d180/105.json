  "text": "-26-\nSIMMONS:\nTAYLOR:\nLet’s get back to this question of melodiousness,\nsomething of which was brought out in our passage from\nthe \"Song of the Forests\" of Shostakovich. Now I\nwould like to submit to all of you musicians here\nwhether or not that piece would not appeal to the\naverage American public, more so let us say, than some\nof the more difficult pieces--Shostakovich?s symphonies\nor for that matter some of the works of Frokofiev even\nbefore the 194$ decree. What would you think of that,\nMr. Taylor?\nOh, I think that you are quite right, that that piece\nwould have a more immediate acceptance than something\nwritten in a more complicated or sophisticated form.\nOf course what they call melodious we would call\ntuneful, and they want tunes at any cost, but I think\nthey overlook one thing—and that is, that what the\naverage man will stand for does not mean that he might\nnot like something a lot better if he had a chance to\nhear it. And under this system there is very little\npossibility of his being allowed to hear any music that\nis at all debatable and, as you said before, an art\nmust progress and retrogress, and I think carried to\nits logical conclusion there could be no such thing as\na symphony, because a symphony is based not on tunes\nbut on themes and could be entirely unintelligible to a\nperson whose musicaL mentality never went beyond that\nparticular Shostakovich piece."
