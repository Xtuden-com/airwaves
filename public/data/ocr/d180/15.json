The ''average1* live in one or\ntwo rooms; their works appear in print less often; they\nhope to write something that will attract the attention\nof the public, or the government or of the leaders of\nthe Writers Union. The 1?grays,? are in the majority.\nMany of them are only candidates for membership in the\nWriters Union and not full-fledged members.\nHow did you feel about the controls and demands of the\ngovernment upon the work of the writer, Mr* Ivanov?\nThere isnft a single writer, not even a Party member,\nwho would consider the governmental control over literature\nbeneficial to literature. Everybody dreams of writing\nas he wishes and what he wishes. Control over literature >\nis the greatest calamity for the writers. This opinion\nof mine is based on numerous conversations with \"leaders,1*\nâ– 'average1* and ''grays,1* and on observations over a\nperiod of almost twenty years. The control of literature\nwas the constant anguish of a writer's soul.\nCan you recall instances during your life as a writer\nwhen severe measures were taken against a writer by the\ngovernment or by the Party?\nI had an article about a peasant komsomol published in\nthe '*Red Guard'* in 1939.\nA komsomol is a member of the Party youth organization,\nis he not?"
