Vilno at the time belonged\nto Lithuania and it was free. My wife was at this time afraid\nto expose the baby to the cold. So we agreed that I will make\nthe attempt alone and then try to arrange for her to get in a\nsafer way to me. But I was caught on the demarcation line and\nput back to prison. I never saw them again. They were later\nboth assassinated by the Germans.\nAfter you were arrested at the demarcation line, what happened\nthen, Mr. Gliksman?\nThen began my real longer prison experience. I spent many\nmonths in the Oshmiana Prison, and later, a shorter time, in\nother prisons.\nWere you ever beaten during these interrogations?\nI personally was never beaten, but I witnessed many of my\ncolleagues, inmates in the prison, coming back from night\ninterrogations, bruised and beaten up badly.\nMr. Gliksman, will you describe the conditions that you found\nwhen you were assigned to a cell?\nWe were three of us brought into the cell No. 1, in Oshmiana;\nthe prisoners were counting, seventy-seven, seventy-eight,\nseventy-nine. It meant that we were the seventy-seventh, sevÂ¬\nenty-eighth, seventy-ninth prisoners coming to the cell. And\non the door I have seen an old Polish sign, because it was an\nold Polish prison, saying, \"Cell No. 1, fifteen men.\""
