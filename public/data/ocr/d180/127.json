This is Alex Inkeles again and\nperhaps I can best answer that by having you listen to\nwhat a Soviet engineer told us about the factory\nmeeting. He was one of 500 former Soviet citizens we\ninterviewed in the Western Zone of Germany,\n(RUSSIAN ACCENT) The Soviet system is a dictatorship\nbut on the other hand you must recognize that there is\nmuch public criticism of both minor and responsible\nofficials. The Party makes the workers criticize the\nfactory directors with the single condition that the\ncriticism be aimed against the director personally\nand not against the Soviet system or the Party.\nWhat was the Party after in encouraging the workers to\ncriticize?\nThe aim of the Party was to show that as a factory\ndirector the things I had done, the mistakes I had\nmade, were not done by the Party or the government.\nThe critical speeches were made to defend the interests\nof the party In other words, the Party disguised its\ninterests as the interests of the people. It wished\nit to appear that I was under the control of the people,\nas though the people wore supporting the party.\nWhat were the limits or boundaries to such criticism?\nOf course, criticism of the Party as such, or of the\nSoviet regime, the Central Committee, the Politbureau\nor Stalin was impossible. It was not permitted. No\ndoubt in their authority could be expressed. A word\nagainst them and that was the end of you.\nDRAMATIC^SWEtL.... . THENJJOIfi UNDER (CUT 5)"
