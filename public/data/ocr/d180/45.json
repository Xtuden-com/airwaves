One\nof its sections administered the great netx^ork of prison-camps\nalready mentioned. Another section was charged with the duty\nof guarding the Soviet borders. Still another, a fully organ¬\nized military force of a half-million picked soldiers, was\nresponsible for the internal security of the state, its protection\nagainst disorder and uprisings. There were many other sections.\nFor instance:\nPHONE. RECEIVER UP\nGeneral of Division Nicolsky speaking.\n(FILTER) Investigator Varanov, Special Section of the NKVD\nhere. Will you be good enough, General, to see me at the\nSpecial Section office this evening, at eleven o’clock?\n(LESS ASSURED) Very well, Comrade Investigator.\nTHE RECEIVER DOWN SLOWLY\n(QUIETLY) The Special Section concerned itself with the loy¬\nalty of the armed forces. (FADING SLIGHTLY) Another section-——\nThe Economic Administration— dealt with wrecking, production\nfailures, sabotage, and, in general, with what is called ’coun¬\nter-revolutionary’ activity in Soviet industry and agriculture.\nThe foreman, Comrade Investigator, seems unable to explain why\nthe boring machines are not giving results within the tolerance\nlimits required.\nVOICE II: His name?"
