A doctor holds a very\ncritical position in the Soviet Union. A certificate\nof illness from a doctor is just about the only\naccepted excuse for a Soviet worker if he's late or\nabsent from work. Otherwise the worker gets fined or\nimprisoned. The fine is stiff. Usually a quarter of\nhis paycheck for six months. And it literally means\na semi-starvation diet for the man and his family.\nThe Soviet trade union offers the worker no protection\nagainst such fines. The only hope is a certificate of\nillness from a doctor."
