At the Second All-Russian Conference of Com¬\nmissars of Justice at Moscow, in July, 1918, a Comrade Lebedev\nraised the crucial question:\nI admit, comrades, the necessity for the existence of these\nExtraordinary Commissions. But I wish to point out that it is\nimportant to delimit their sphere of activity. Otherwise we\nshall have a state within a state. Comrade Terastvatsaturov\nhas shown us how acute- this question is in the provinces. To\nsay—as he reports the President of the Orel Cheka as having\nsaid—-”I am responsible to no one, my powers are such that I\ncan shoot anybody”-demonstrates how easily an organ like the\nCheka tends to widen its authority more and more.\nComrade Lebedev was answered by the Commissar of Justice, Niko¬\nlai N. Krestinsky. In the light of what later happened to Com¬\nmissar Krestinsky, his reply is worth remembering:\nSo long as the Cheka functions,, the work of justice must take\na secondary place, and its sphere of activity must be consid¬\nerably curtailed.\nA member of the Cheka, Comrade Peters, was more blunt:\nIn its activity the Cheka is completely independent, carrying\nout searches, arrests, shootings (and) afterwards making a\nreport to the Council of People's Commissars and the Soviet\nCentral Executive Committee."
