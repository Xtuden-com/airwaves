Comrade Investigator, to lay\nbefore you my doubts concerning Comrade Koryabin’s reliability.\nYes?\nAt our last unit meeting, during the discussion of the need for\nconstant vigilance against the Bukharinite-Trotskyite bloc of\nwreckers and spies, Comrade Koryabin stated that some of those\nalready arrested and punished may not be guilty of counter-revolu¬\ntionary activity. (BEGINNING TO FADE) Now, when you compare\nthat remark with what he said in his address to the Komsomol\nCommittee last-\nChurch and religious sects, national minorities, and members\nof the intelligentsia were all objects of the Secret Political\nAdministration’s interest. Another section, the Counter-Intel¬\nligence Administration, sought out foreign agents within the\ncountry, and carefully checked on foreign visitors and embassies.\nThe Foreign Administration was principally an espionage organization\noperating outside the Soviet Union; one of its duties was to\nkeep an eye on Soviet personnel stationed in foreign countries.\nAs the Canadian spy investigation in 1946 revealed, it also\nrecruited agents from among Communists, Communist sympathizers,\nand others, who passed along information of interest to the\nSoviet Government."
