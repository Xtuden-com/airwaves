I -wonder if\nthis sly one knows about the ministry call.\nDOOR OPENING....CLOSING\n(ALOUD) Ah, good evening, Comrade Party Secretary, I\nwas not expecting you but of course I will always find\ntime to see you.\nI was a bit early for the factory meeting and the\nthought came to me, how is my good friend Comrade\nDirector. You look troubled, Comrade.\nJust tired. Too many nights in the factory. Olga\nFyodorovna says she is a factory widow.\n(HALF LAUGH) To be tired is one look.,..to be troubled\nanother. When I walked in here I said to myself -\nSergei Sergeyevich, something.... something is bothering\nDimitri Ivanovitch. And then a thought came to me....\nperhaps it was the phone call.\nPhone call?\nWhen I first asked to see you, your secretary told me\nyou were tied up with an important phone call. Bad\nnews, Comrade?\nShe was mistaken. It was only a call from our supply\ntrouble-shooter.\nYou know, as I sat outside, I played a little game with\nmyself. I kept guessingâ€”who this important phone call\nwas from. Regional Party Headquarters? Perhaps. A\nspokesman from the central committee? Not likely. The\nsecret police? Or perhaps just the Ministry."
