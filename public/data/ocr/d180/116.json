I want to give\na few instructions to some of the Communist Youth\nLeague boys before the meeting tonight.

And on the non-military, the\nworst that could happen is that we fall a few per cent\nbehind the plan. So we don't get our bonuses. That\nI don't like; still we have not done badly these past\ntwo years. Always had a little fat set aside for\nemergencies too, eh? (QUICK SLY LAUGH)\n-more-"
