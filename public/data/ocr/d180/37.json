We con conclude our\ndiscussion of Soviet music with a few bars from a\nsong which none of our listeners will fail to\nrecognize—Khachaturian*s I*$abre Dance.\"\nJFEW_BARS 0F_ ™SaBRE DAKCE;fJ_\nNow, in this total program dealing largely with the\nsubject of controls in Soviet art, one might say that\ndown through the ages right up to the present time art\neverywhere has always been subject to forms of control.\nClearly the artist, whether he be a composer, writer,\npainter, or dramatist, and whether his metier be\nrealism or fantasy, cannot escape the compelling\ninfluence of the imperatives of his social environment\nor the idols of his own creative personality. He is\nnever a wholly free spirit. But whatever open or hidden\ncontrols may exist for the Western artist—economic,\nsocial, legal, or personal—the fact remains that he\nalways has freedom of choice to select his subject and\ntreat it as he desires—a vital condition for the\nproper functioning of the creative artist. But the\nSoviet artist today does not enjoy this freedom of\nchoice. Limits are placed on the areas of human ex¬\nperience he can reflect in art, and his creative mind\nis restricted to the patterns of ideas, beliefs, and\nloyalties prescribed by the Party. Today, it would\nappear, the whole of Soviet art must be devoted to the\ngreater glory of the Communist Party."
