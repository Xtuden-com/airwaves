  "text": "-32-\nSLONXMSKY: (CONT) and formalist and not worthy of aiy praise, and\ndenouncing the critic for praising himself. I believe\nthat this episode is unique in musichistory.\nSIMONS: There does not seem to be much more to be said about\nKhachaturian1s recantation, but I suppose by all odds\nProkofiev has been one of the most individualistic of\nSoviet composers and one wonders, Mr. Cowell, whether\nhis particular genius, unlike the disciplined genius\nof Shostakovich, can continue to function with anything\nlike maximum effectiveness under such rigorous controls.\nCOWELL: I don't think so^ because the rigid control sets up\ncertain particular standards, such as the avoidance of\ndissonance, as being something that wouldnTt be suitable\nfor people to listen to, and it seems to me that the\nnatural style of Shostakovich is a style that demands\nfree handling of dissonance and possibly that if left\nto his own devices without the support of the Central\nParty and their firm ruling on this subject, that he\nmight even have dabbled in atonality, who knows; but\nobviously he can't hope to retain his position as a\nprofessional composer and still do that under the\npresent circumstances in Russia.\nSIMMONS: Of course I myself, incidentally, haven't heard any of\nthe post-194^ music of Prokofiev so I am not in a\npostion to say whether or not he has changed in his\nmedium in the face of the Resolution of the Central\nCommittee. Have you by any chance, Mr. Slonimsky,\nheard any of it?"
