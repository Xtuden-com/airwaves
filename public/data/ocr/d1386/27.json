This in turn means a much lower maintenance cost,\nparticularly for transmitters of low power (1000 watts\nand less).\nIncorporation of this new modulation system in the\nType 250-W transmitter shown above has brought the\ncost of a set of tubes for this transmitter to considerably\nless than half of that of comparative transmitters of the\nsame power rating.\nRCA Victor Company, Inc.\nA Radio Corporation of America Subsidiary\nCAMDEN, N.
