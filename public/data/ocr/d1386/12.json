Ter¬\nrell will be chief. Commissioner Thad\nBrown will supervise the operations of\nthe new division.\nThe functions of the Division of\nField Operations will be about the same\nas those of the Radio Division. All the\npersonnel of the Radio Division has\nbeen retained. It is believed, however,\nthat a number of changes will be made\nbefore the summer is over. The execu¬\ntive order directed the Commission to\nconsolidate activities as much as possi¬\nble in order to avoid duplication of\neffort.\n\"The Federal Radio Commission is\nhereby authorized and directed,” said\nthe order, \"to dismiss officers and em¬\nployes not indispensable to the serv¬\nice, to make such changes in titles, des¬\nignations, and duties of officers and em¬\nployes as it may deem necessary, and\nto return to the Treasury all appropria¬\ntions or unexpended balances not nec¬\nessary to the maintenance of the Com¬\nmission.”\nWeiss Goes To WJR\nLos Angeles . . . Lewis Allen Weiss,\nmanager for the Don Lee Broadcasting\nSystem, and prominent in national ad¬\nvertising circles, resigns from the Don\nLee organization effective August 1,\n1932, to take over new duties as vice-\npresident of WJR, Detroit. His succes¬\nsor at the KHJ headquarters of Don\nLee has not yet been announced.\nLeaving Los Angeles August 1, after\ntwo years of unprecedented success as\nbusiness mentor of the Don Lee System,\nMr. Weiss will proceed to Detroit\nwhere his headquarters will be in the\ntower of the Fisher Building. His new\nscope of activities will extend also to\nstation WGAR, Cleveland.\nWeiss is one of the most unusual\nand successful figures in the country’s\nadvertising field. Graduated from Kent\nCollege of Law in 1914, he started out\non a career in law. In 1927 he majored\nin advanced economics of merchandis¬\ning, marketing and advertising, at the\nUniversity of Southern California, and\nholds the only diploma of its kind ever\nissued. He was likewise given the Alpha\nDelta Sigma key, fourteenth advertising\nman in the United States to be awarded\nthis honor.\nFrom 1917 to 1919 he commanded\nthe famous Black Horse Troup of the\nFourth Cavalry, and today is familiarly\ngreeted as \"Cap’n Weiss” by scores of\nhis old buddies and associates.\nHe is a director of the Advertising\nClub of Los Angeles, member of the\nCommercial Managers, Attention!\nNational Broadcast Reporter has\nreceived a request from Mr. Fred M.\nJordan, of the Hanff-Metzger adver¬\ntising agency, for information about\nthe use of radio in connection with\nthe sale of a food product. National\nBroadcast Reporter has some data on\nthis subject, but it desires more com¬\nplete and up-to-date information for\nMr. Jordan. National Broadcast Re¬\nporter would be glad to receive as\nmuch information as possible on the\npoints raised.\nHere is Mr. Jordan’s letter:\nGentlemen:\nIn connection with a survey which\nwe are making for a client of ours,\nwe are very anxious to obtain infor¬\nmation concerning the use of radio in\nthe sale of a food product. We would\nbe very appreciative of any charts,\ndata, or information which you may\nhave on the following points:\n1. Do you know of any food prod¬\nucts, either national or local, which\nhave been put over in a marketing\nway solely through the use of radio?\n2. If so, what are the names of\nthese food products, how wide spread\nwas the distribution, and about how\nmuch money was invested in the ra¬\ndio program?\n3. Do you know of any food prod¬\nucts which have been noticeably aid¬\ned through the addition of a radio\nprogram, this benefit resulting\nthrough either:\na. Actual increased sales, or\nb. Decreased cost per sale.\n4. Do you know of any national\nor local food advertisers whose ac¬\ntual sales have dropped through the\ndiscontinuance of a radio program?\n5. Can you give us any accurate\napproximation of the relative\namount of money spent by the ten\nlargest national food advertisers on\nnewspaper, magazine, and radio? We\nare endeavoring to determine about\nwhat percentage of the budget at the\npresent time is devoted to radio ad¬\nvertising.\nI feel certain that the above infor¬\nmation is available, and it occurred\nto me that you are most likely to\nhave such data on file. I trust that\nwe are not presuming too much on\nyour generosity in asking for your\nhelp in this matter.\nFred M. Jordan,\nManager, Los Angeles Office,\nHanff-Metzger,\n929 South Broadway,\nLos Angeles, California.\nJonathan Club, and member of the\nspeakers’ bureau of the National As¬\nsociation of Advertising Clubs.\nIn the two years he has guided the\ndestinies of KHJ and other stations of\nthe Don Lee System,, he has wrought\nan iron-clad record of success in the\nradio business. Under his management\nthe Los Angeles key station, KHJ, has\nbecome not only one of the outstanding\nstations of the country, but a valued and\nimportant spoke in the mighty wheel of\nthe Columbia Broadcasting System, and\nfocal point for network activities of the\ntwo systems on the Pacific Coast.\nA young man of energy, foresight,\nand genuine ability, Weiss goes to his\nnew position bearing the well-wishes\nnot only of his old associates but of\ncountless hundreds of friends on the\nPacific Coast. Great things are predicted\nfor him, and, on the strength of his\npast successes, he cannot do otherwise\nthan justify these expectations.\nCKOK Results\nApproximately 25 per cent of the re¬\nceiving sets cannot get CKOK, CBS’s\naffiliate station at Windsor, Ontario.\nThat was the testimony of Andy Ring,\nRadio Commission senior engineer, who\nis nationally regarded as an expert in\nsuch matters.\nCKOK operates on 540 kilocycles,\nwhich is 10 kilocycles outside the reg¬\nular broadcast band.\nRing’s testimony was given during\nthe hearing on WXYZ’s application\nfor 1020 kilocycles.\n\"Is it not a fact,” Ring was asked,\n\"that the official reports show that in\nnumerous instances receivers are not\npicking it (CKOK) up because of its\nwave length?”\n\"I do not believe I have had any\nreports that may be considered entirely\nofficial,” replied Ring, \"but I have had\nengineering reports which go to indi¬\ncate that that is a fact.”\n\"Would you expect as good recdp-\ntion, Mr. Ring, from a station operating\nin the regular broadcasting band be¬\ntween 550 and 1500 kilocycles?”\n\"If the receiving set was so designed\nas to tune 540 kilocycles properly, there\nshould be no reason why the reception\nshould be impaired,” was the answer.\n\"But certain of the receivers cut off in\ntheir tuning before reaching 540 kilo¬\ncycles and accordingly on those receivers\nthe reception may be impaired from\nvery poor to fair, and possibly unobtain¬\nable.”\n\"That is true with a large number of\nsets, isn’t it?”\n\"The exact percentage of sets that\nfall into that class I could not say,\nbut possibly not over 25 per cent.”"
