One\nguess is as good as another.\nSeveral persons prominent in radio\nare being mentioned around Washing¬\nton as possible successors of the Gen¬\neral. Among them are Harry Shaw,\npresident of the N. A. B.; William\nHedges, manager of WMAQ, Chicago;\nJames W. Baldwin, secretary of the\nCommission; Duke Patrick, chief coun¬\nsel of the Commission; and H. D.\nHayes, radio supervisor at Chicago. The\nfact that they are being mentioned in¬\ndicates neither that they will or that\nthey will not be appointed. It is merely\nthe talk of those who do not know a\ngreat deal about it.\nIn semi-official circles it is believed\nthe President may appoint someone\nwho has not had a great deal of ex¬\nperience in radio.\nThe resignation of the General is at¬\ntributed to two things. He never has\nbeen very enthusiastic about the job.\nWhen Congress cut his pay,* there was\nno longer any incentive for the Gen¬\neral to remain.\nThere is a lot of speculation as to\nwho will succeed the General as chair¬\nman. In all probability it will be Col¬\nonel Thad Brown. Judge E. O. Sykes\nwill serve as acting chairman until a\nnew chairman has been appointed.\nWhether the Commission will wait for\nthe appointment of the new member\nbefore selecting a chairman is not\nknown.\nSaltzman was appointed to the Com¬\nmission in 1929 and has served ^s\nchairman since 1930. He is a native oX,\nIowa, his home being at Des Moines.\nHe celebrated the fortieth anniversary\nof his entry into the government serv¬\nice on June 13, 1932.\nHearings\nA steaming pot in which boiled the\ndesires of many broadcasters.

WIP and WFAN\ncoveted 1020. WCAU wanted to change\nto 1020. WO WO and WWVA each\nwanted full time instead of dividing\nwith each other. Many stations, caught\nin the maelstrom, sought renewal of li¬\ncenses.\nSeventeen stations were directly in¬\nvolved in the hearing which began on\nMonday. Thirty-seven others were noti¬\nfied.\nGeneral Saltzman . . . resigns from Radio\nCommission.\nNobody would predict when it would\nbe over. It was hoped that ten days\nwould suffice.\nChief Examiner Ellis A. Yost heard\nthe applications of KTM, Los Angeles,\nand KELW, Burbank, each seeking full\ntime operation, and each asking for\nrenewal of license. At present, the two\nstations divide time on 780.\nExaminers’ Reports\nExaminer R. H. Hyde recommended\nthat KFWI, San Francisco, be denied\nrenewal of license.\n\"The programs broadcast over, appli¬\ncant’s station during January, 1932, and\nat other times, by one Alburtus,” said\nHyde, \"did not serve public interest,\nconvenience or necessity. No basis what¬\never is shown for the ability or method\nby which Alburtus presumed to foretell\nfuture events for those submitting ques¬\ntions in accordance with his conditions.\nHis broadcasts must therefore be con¬\nsidered fortune-telling programs. They\nwere presented, the evidence shows con¬\nclusively, for the purpose of obtaining\nmoney from the public for practically\nnothing. (A chart was mailed each\nquestioner.)\n\"The licensee has permitted the use\nof the station by at least one other party\n(Alburtus) for his own personal bene¬\nfit. The licensee, applicant in this pro¬\nceeding, admits turning over a very sub¬\nstantial amount of time for the use of\none Alburtus for a percentage of the\nreturns. That the time turned over to\nAlburtus was used to fleece the public\nhas been indicated. The benefits, then,\nwere for Alburtus and the station own¬\ners, certainly not the public.\n\"The station was used by one Al¬\nburtus during January, 1932, and at\nother times during the license period\nending March 31, 1932, to deliver per¬\nsonal messages to private individuals.\nSample broadcasts submitted by the ap¬\nplicant show messages could not pos¬\nsibly cover any other situation than that\nof the party submitting the question.\nIn each answer the party for whom it\nwas intended was identified by his ques¬\ntion and address sufficiently to obviate\nthe necessity of naming him. Allowing\nAlburtus the use of the broadcasting\nstation for the purpose of delivering\nmessages to individuals in this manner\nwas manifestly incohsistent with the\nduty of the licensee to provide broad¬\ncast service for the benefit of the gen¬\neral public.\n\"The applicant, through its manager,\npromises reforms. This does not seem\nadequate assurance or a sufficient basis,\nin view of the evidence regarding the\napplicant corporation and its record,\non which to conclude that the granting\nof a renewal application would serve\npublic interest, convenience or neces¬\nsity.”\nExaminer Elmer W. Pratt recom¬\nmended that WAAB, Boston, be de¬\nnied authority to increase power from\n500 to 1000 watts.\n\"WAAB is but one of four major sta¬\ntions in Boston from which the metro¬\npolitan area of that city receives serv¬\nice, said Pratt, \"and although from the\nviewpoint of the applicant an increase\nin power would be desirable, it never-"
