This should provide a factor of\nsufficiency which is altogether desirable.\nBy W. C. Bridges\nRadio Station WEBC, Superior, Wis.\nRelative to station coverage and the\nattitude of Edgar Felix, we would state\nthat our normal day range is 100 to\n150 miles. During the evening we are\nhandicapped at certain times by hetero¬\ndyning on our frequency or by other\ninterference from stations operating on\nit, so that our average probably is in the\nneighborhood of 40 miles. When this\ninterference is absent, due to the fact\nthat distant stations are depressed or\nnot coming through, our night range\noften is the same as during the daytime.\nSome fading is met on occasions during\nthe evening, but normally is beyond the\n40-mile estimate given above.\nWe have asked the Federal Radio\nCommission for permission to relocate\nour transmitter and to make certain im¬\nprovements in our radiator, through\nwhich we hope to expand our range con¬\nsiderably. When this work is completed,\nwe propose to have a field strength sur¬\nvey made in order that we may be in a\nposition to give an accurate measure¬\nment of our coverage.\nBy Marie Williams Vandergrift\nRadio Station WAIU, Columbus, Ohio\nMost advertisers and radio people\nnow know that the coverage on a sta¬\ntion varies materially as it is affected\nby atmospheric, mechanical, and other\nconditions. Station WAIU claims to\ncover Ohio, and for that reason we use\nthe slogan \"The Voice of Ohio.’’ We\nwere very much surprised, when the Co¬\nlumbia Broadcasting System compiled a\nchart showing our coverage, to find that\nwe had, according to response received\nby their advertisers while broadcasting\nover our station, an amazing secondary\ncoverage. And the strange part of it is\nthat on tests we have run recently this\ncoverage is represented repeatedly.\nTwo years ago, when we were at¬\ntempting to secure an audience response\nin an endeavor to get attention centered\non our plea for additional night time\nfor our station, we appealed for sworn\naffidavits from our listening audience\nand within a very short time we had on\nfile in Columbus 213,000 such affidavits.\nTaking into consideration the inconveni¬\nence and energy necessary to prepare\nand send in an affidavit, we considered\nthat this was a remarkable demonstra¬\ntion of our coverage.\nStation KDKA, Pittsburgh, has a\nBureau Set-up which analyzes coverage\nvery specifically. This certainly does\nmeasure coverage accurately, but it takes\ntime.\nMr. Hart\nBy Fred J. Hart\nRadio Station KQW, San Jose\nIn this territory we will not take off\nour hats to any station regardless of\npower. With the exception of natural\ndead spots, anyone with a good re¬\nceiver can get us in this area with good\nvolume. Our actual coverage is evi¬\ndenced by the fact that farmers using\nour market service every day live many\nmiles away from the station. Radio\ncoverage cannot be figured on a piece\nof paper, as it is governed by the nature\nof the country and the distance from\nother stations.\nBy C. W. Corkhill\nRadio Station KSCJ, Sioux City, Iowa\nKSCJ has in the past year heard from\nabout 35 states. We received 17 letters\nfrom New Zealand, one from Prooma,\nSouth Australia, and several from Ha¬\nwaii and the Canal Zone—all of which\nmeans coverage of a sort that would\nbe of interest only to radio fans wanting\ndistance or to the engineers interested\nin the strength and efficiency of the\nsignal. To the shrewd advertiser, such a\nshowing would naturally be meaningless.\nWhat advertisers are interested in is\nthe major audience of any given station.\nIn our radio coverage maps and fig¬\nures, we cite a coverage of approxi¬\nmately 75 to 100 miles, or not more\nthan 4 counties in any given direction\nfrom KSCJ, an area with a population\nof a little over 788,000. Even this is\nsomewhat misleading, for within that\nradius there are 3 other broadcasting sta¬\ntions, each having more listeners at point\nof broadcast than we have at that point.\nOmaha, for example, is not so far\nfrom Sioux City, and we regularly get\nfan mail from there; but with 2 or\n3 very efficient broadcasting stations in\nOmaha, we would never thing of using\nthat as a talking point with an adver¬\ntiser.\nA 50,000-watt station several hundred\nmiles from Sioux City will not have\nthe punch and wallop in our trade ter¬\nritory that we do.\nIt is the writer’s belief that the aver¬\nage person, in tuning in a station, fol¬\nlows the line of least resistance—tuning\nin the station he can get the easiest,\nclearest, etc., and therein lie, it seems\nto me, the principle reasons why any\nclaim of enormous coverage by any\nbroadcasting station, regardless of\npower, is misleading.\nThe Chicago Tribune is a very fine\nnewspaper—is read in Sioux City—but\nit certainly does not have the circulation\nthat the local newspapers do—and so\nit is with broadcasting stations.\nSo, with broadcasting stations as they\nare—pretty well scattered over the\nUnited States—anl claims for unusual\ncoverage from a major audience stand¬\npoint, should, in the writer’s opinion, be\ntaken with the proverbial grain of salt.\nBy A. W. Upchurch\nRadio Station KGGM, Albuquerque, N. M.\nI am quite sure that most radio sta¬\ntions have a larger coverage than they\nare given credit for. Speaking for our\nstation, I would say that we have con¬\nstant listeners throughout the five states\nadjoining or near to New Mexico, as\nwe get occasional fan mail from Penn¬\nsylvania, California, New York, Ohio,\nand Michigan, and have had one letter\nfrom Canada in which the listener states\nthat he gets our station at nearly any\ntime of the day. Consequently, I know\nthat KGGM has a larger coverage than\nthat with which we are credited.\nWe are having very nice success for\nthe firms who have advertising pro¬\ngrams with us."
