Even though\nthis station does not adequately serve\nthe entire area, the area is adequately\nserved by existing stations.\n\"Although the operation of WAAB\nwith 1000 watts would not result in\nobjectionable interference with the serv¬\nice of stations operating on adjacent\nchannels, the interference of WAAB’s\nsignal within the 1-millivolt-per-meter\ncontours of WRBX, WHIS, and\nWBCM would be increased; and while\nthe latter stations are now limited by\nother stations on the same frequency\nto areas of 5 millivolts or more, and\ndespite the fact that the proposed in¬\ncrease in power would not further limit\nthese stations, the granting of this in¬\ncrease would be a substantial bar to\nthe elimination of such interference as\nnow exists within the 1-millivolt-per-\nmeter line of the stations on the same\nchannel, and would be inconsistent with\nthe Commission’s policy of protecting\nthe service areas of regional stations\nto the 1-millivolt-per-meter contour as\nset forth on page 32 of the Commis¬\nsion’s Fifth Annual Report.\n\"The mere fact that objectionable in¬\nterference now exists does not justify\nincreasing any of the factors of inter¬\nference which exist within the 1-milli¬\nvolt-per-meter line. Rather it would be\nnecessary to deny any application which,\nif granted, would result in such an in¬\ncrease, in order that no greater handi¬\ncap might be placed upon the Com¬\nmission than already exists in attempt¬\ning to clear interference from areas\nwhich are intended to be served by the\nstations already licensed.”\nChief Examiner Ellis A.
