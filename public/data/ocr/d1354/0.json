Their technique — 'loud outcries\nwhich grounded a 4-man NAEB study team\nless than 12 hours before takeoff for New\nDelhi from Washington, D.C. Under the\ndirection of Dr. Kenneth Wright of the\nUniversity of Tennessee, the team planned\nto conduct an on-the-spot investigation of\nproblems involved in expanding official In¬\ndian broadcasts, All-India Radio. The main\naim was to get first-hand news on crop,\npest and weather conditions quickly to\nfarmers scattered throughout the country\nin more than half a million villages. News\nwould be in local dialects.\nThose participating in the project includ¬\ned Dr. Floyd E. Carlson, State University\nof N.Y. College of Forestry; Ovid Gano\nfrom the J. Hillis Miller Health Center,\nUniversity of Florida; Mr. Macdonald Wig¬\ngins, Martin Company, Orlando Division.\nThe idea originated with the U. S. Agen¬\ncy for International Development Mission\nto India and had the approval of Mrs. In¬\ndira Ghandi, Prime Minister of India.\nFifty key leaders in education, govern¬\nment, industry, and the arts will meet this\nfall to establish effective ways of utilizing\nradio more thoroughly here and abroad.\nNER executive director Jerrold Sandler an¬\nnounced that the conference will be sup¬\nported by the Johnson Foundation because\nof its belief that “radio is an under-de¬\nveloped educational resource.”\nMr. Sandler commented, “There has long\nbeen the need to bring together outstand¬\ning people in major fields who have con¬\ntributed significantly to the nation’s edu¬\ncational and cultural growth to devise prac¬\ntical suggestions for developing radio to\nits full potential.” The Wingspread Con¬\nference on Educational Radio as a Nation¬\nal Resource is scheduled for September 26-\n28, Johnson Foundation, Racine, Wisconsin.\nBefore The FCC\nThe Federal Communications Commission\nrejected NAEB’s Petition for Reconsidera¬\ntion of its Fifth Report and Order, on July\n12. The Fifth Report, released in March,\n1966, announced a Table of Assignments in\nwhich the number of UHF assignments and\nthe number of reservations were fewer\nthan in previous Commission assignment\nplans.\nIn its Petition the NAEB said that the\nunsaturated framework of the assignment\ntable resulted in fewer educational reserva¬\ntions and therefore deprived the education¬\nal community of essential frequency space.\nOf special concern is the Commission’s\nattitude toward the use of broadcast fre¬\nquencies for instructional purposes. In its\nJuly 13 Memorandum the Commission says\n“if the broadcast channels are used to serve\na relatively limited number of pre-planned\nreceiving points they are, in effect, with¬\ndrawn from the broadcasting service, there¬\nby compounding an already serious short¬\nage. If there were no other way to reach\nthe pre-selected receiving points the use of\nthe broadcast channels could be justified.”\nAID, currently guiding India in food\nproduction and family planning, had asked\nNAEB to choose leading communications\nspecialists who would make recommenda¬\ntions for the overall radio system, as well\nas the type of low-power, low-cost trans¬\nmitter most suitable, development of serv¬\niceable transistor receivers that could be\nmanufactured in India, sold inexpensively\nto the populace.\nControversy erupted when an Indian\nnews agency reported that transmitters\nwould be placed in every one of India’s\n320 districts, to be manned by American\ntechnicians, with Peace Corps volunteers\npreparing broadcast materials. The charge\nwas denied by both American and Indian\nspokesmen.\nThe left-wing press seized the opportuni¬\nty to stir anti-U.S. feelings, focusing on\n/—\" what it considers American economic press¬\nure to divert India from its socialist path.\nThe pro-Communist daily, The Patriot,\ncalled the proposed network “more danger¬\nous than the Voice of America.”\nIn separate statements filed before the\nFederal Communications Commission, both\nthe NAEB and the State Educational Tele¬\nvision Agency for the State of Iowa op¬\nposed a petition filed by Mark Twain\nBroadcasting (KHMO), a commercial\nbroadcaster in Hannibal, Mo. KHMO aims\nto uproot Channel 12, Iowa City, to make\nroom for a Channel 12 assignment in Han¬\nnibal. NAEB stressed “that facilities to be\nutilized by Iowa for initiating VHF state¬\nwide coverage must be located to provide\neffective coverage to prime population cen¬\nters,” reminding “Iowa plans to pool all\neducational resources hi an interconnected\nservice for key areas.” In written testimony\nnow before the FCC, NAEB says applica¬\ntion of The Board of Regents of the Uni¬\nversities and State Colleges of Arizona,\nlicensee of KUAT, Channel 6, Tucson, to\nrelocate its transmitter, increase power is\nin the public interest. Statement includes\nobjections to a related FCC proposal to de¬\nlete reservation on Channel 10 at Silver\nCity, New Mexico, along with complete\ndeletion of Channel 6 from that area.\nThe NAEB petition cited the difficulty of\npre-selecting receiving points and of de¬\ntermining reasonable criteria for establish¬\ning a “relatively limited number.” The\nCommission Memorandum indicated that\n“various alternates (have been provided)\nfor the various needs of educators . . .\nThe Instructional Television Fixed Service\nis specifically tailored for classroom instruc¬\ntion and other related administrative func¬\ntions.”\nThe Commission’s Memorandum termin¬\nates this aspect of the UHF Assignment\nproceeding. Further decisions will deal with\nthe use of Channels 70-83 that have been\nset aside by the FCC as possible “low-\npower community-type” television stations.\nDean Rusk Reappoints Harley\nPresident William G. Harley will con¬\ntinue to serve as NAEB representative to\nthe U. S. National Commission for UNES¬\nCO. The term ends in fall, 1968.\n1"
