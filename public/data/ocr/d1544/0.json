They also pointed\nout that the small staffs of educational\nstations cannot cope with the often long,\narduous tasks of obtaining copyright clear¬\nances.\nAll urged the adoption of a revision\nwritten by the Ad Hoc Committee on Copy¬\nright Law, a committee representing some\nthirty national education organizations.\nCalifornians, Please Note\nThe California State Board of Education\nhas approved the NAEB for membership\nby schools and by county superintendents\nof schools for the years 1965-66, 1966-67,\nand 1967-68.\nBrown Joins NAEB Staff\nJack Brown joins the NAEB staff in\nWashington on July 1 as assistant director\nof research and development.
