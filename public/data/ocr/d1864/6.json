  "text": "members of this Association are presenting programs intended for school use. As\na result of your experience you have discovered many problems about which you would\nbe happy to find solutions. If you will outline and mail your problems to me I\nwill endeavor to secure the answers to them as part of my study. Since I am to\nsail about the first of October, it is important that you send these questions to\nme immediately*\nThanks to the assistance which has been rendered to me by some of the members\nof this group as well as by others, I have tabulated already a number of questions\nwhich I hope to answer in connection with my investigation*\nOne correspondent wants me to discover how to make brodcasts dramatically\nsatisfactory without departing so far from the usual school procedure that teachers\nthe\nwill decide that/broadcast is not educational*\nA second wishes to know the extent to which the European governments broad¬\ncasting services are using broadcasts into classrooms as a means of indoctrination\nof children in the political philosophies actuating the national governments\ndoing the broadcasting.\nAnother wonders 7/hat method is used to teach teachers to use radio effectively.\nStill another is curious to know whether there should be a division in respon¬\nsibility in the presentation of school broadcasts as between the national, state,\nand local authorities.\nA fifth believes that too much school broadcasting has consisted in duplica¬\nting over the radio what is now being done in the classroom. He hopes that the\nstudy will discover specific ways in which radio can render a unique service.\nTime will not permit me to mention other equally pertinent suggestions."
