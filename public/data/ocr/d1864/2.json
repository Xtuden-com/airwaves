By serving as a ’’holding company\" or mouth¬\npiece\" for all of the educational groups of the country, the National Committee\non Education by Radio amplified the relatively weak voice of education and se¬\ncured the attention of and a hearing from the broadcasters, the regulatory body,\nand the public at large. The various steps which have been taken in the accom¬\nplishment of this and the improved situation which has resulted are both too\nwell known by members of this group to need enumeration.\nIn enumerating the services which have been rendered by the National Com¬\nmittee on Education by Radio I referred briefly to our contact with the regula¬\ntory body. We keep closely in touch with the Federal Communications Commission\nand with the Congress. <e secure copies of the various bills introduced both\nin the Senate and in the House, ^e communicate with the members who introduce\nthe bills, and place ourselves at the service of any Senator or Representative\nor of any Congressional Committee when we can furnish helpful information.\nTime will not permit me to cite the various and sundry' bills which were\nintroduced into the first session of the Seventy-fourth Congress. Howeve’r, it\nis evident from the nature of soipe of them that the Committee’s proposal for a\nsupplemental national chain to be operated by the government is receiving serious\nconsideration in legislative circles*\nOne of the best methods of determining the attitude of the Federal Communi¬\ncations Commission is thru the public utterances of its members. We secure copies\nof every public address made by a member of the Commission. Whenever statements a\nare made which we deem important to education they are Quoted in Education by Radio*"
