The usual procedure at the meeting was to listen\nto the particular lecture, after which there was discussion on the various points\nbrought up in the lecture, or provided in the supplementary outline obtained from\nthe instructor. In some cases the radio teachers acted as group leaders, while in\nother cases a leader was appointed from the group.\nOne interesting case in a. rural section of Ohio was found where a county teacher\nfound it impractical to assemble groups. Notebooks were provided for a group of\nlisteners, however, and the county teacher visited each student at regular intervals\nand discussed the notes that had been made by the student. A complete report on\nthe activities of listening groups in the Ohio ^Emergency Radio Junior College was\nmade by C. W. Pettegrew, of the V70SU staff, in the February 28, 1935 issue of\nEducation by Radio published by the National Committee on Education by Radio*\nWe have made application to establish the radio junior college project thruout\nthe school year, 1935-36, as a WPA project. The Emergency Schools Administration\nhas requested this procedure. Present plans also call for supervising directly\nfrom the junior college office at WOSU a staff of forty county teachers* These\nteachers will be employed by the county relief chairman, but their activities and\nwork will be directed from one central source. We hope that in this manner full\nbenefit of the opportunity of making personal contacts in the county will be ob¬\ntained. These county teachers receive from y50 to y70 per month, depending upon\nthe population of the county, and are usually unemployed school teachers. The\ntotal budget requested, including the salary of the county teachers, amounts to\nnearly y30,0'0*)*\n§m"
