Why call the delegates to this confer¬\nence \"Educational Broadcasters?\" All broadcasters are educators of their audiences ,\na fact often overlooked. The distinguishing purpose of this group is that they\nplace education first while other broadcasters make education an incidental mat¬\nter. To state it another way, this group aims primarily to advance American\nculture. All broadcasting influences the listeners, raising or lowering their\nstandards of taste, information, and ideals.\n-r^JL } , I,, **\nA simpler title for this address would be \"A Public Broadcasting Ser-\nA. 'A\nvice.\" The terra \"educational\" suggests schools, but broadcasting is bigger\nthan schools. It is the greatest instrument since the invention of printing\nfor the entertainment, the information, and the education of all citizens. It\ntalks to millions of homes both far and near. It calls a whole nation instant¬\nly into conference. It transforms America into one great town meeting. \n.ships upon the sea, the planes in the air, the speeding car or train,\" the desert\nand the mountain top are reached alike by this modern wizard. It is the most\npowerful instrument ever invented for effective team work by a whole nation.\nIt can give all the people America's best in thought and entertainment, or it\ncan broadcast the inferior and the poorest. The life of all America can be\nelevated or debased by the use made of radio. It can raise us up or put us\ndown. It is a public instrument that should be used for public good."
