  "text": "-5-\nThis action does require a formal Board decision, however, so I am\nconvening a special meeting of the full Board for Friday, October 21,\nat 5:30 p.m. in my suite at the Muehlebach Hotel. The purpose of the\nmeeting will be to elect Mr. Henry to the unexpired term of Leonard\nMarks. This will only take a short time and I feel this is a more\ngraceful way to handle the matter than to have it on the regular\nBoard meeting agenda. (This is, of course, on the advice of\nReuben Clark, our \"constitution\" counselor.\nWGH:mab"
