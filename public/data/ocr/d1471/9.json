Information\nnot compiled, however, proves the danger of- identifying a group which\nsays;it has written (at least once) with those who write frequently.\nA mail count at various stations, broken down occupationally,\nwould, we believe, reveal« interestina results concerning frequent\nwriters as opposed to those whose influence is very rarely exerted by\nmail. The figures representing manufacturers' and governments’ employ¬\nees as writers of letters are generally* in line with the results of\nprevious) Indiana University surveys concerning these groups' interest\nin radio, regardless of whether they are for or against it."
