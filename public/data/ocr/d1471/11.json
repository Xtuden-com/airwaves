If a newspaper survey were:inprogress how\nfair would the newspaper have been considered? Canadian listeners,1if\nthe small sample has any validity, seem quite sure their radio news:is fair\nU. S. three-station cities seem least sure, but radio journalism in: Indiana\nseems to enjoy general respect as compared with that of other U. S. areas\ncovered. Personally interviewed people, again, seemed more positively\ninclined than those interviewed by telephone. Professional people and\nresidents of large cities seemed less-sure of the fairness of radio news\nthan other groups. : It would be interesting to ask the same type of ques¬\ntion, classifying the replies of respondents by political affiliation."
