Not so expected was the discovery that farmers, who made up\nall but about 20% of the \"Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery\" classifica¬\ntion, were second highest in this regard.\nThe other1 subdivisions seem to reveal results consistent with observa¬\ntions made earlier regarding city size, personal interview effects, etc.\nThe three'-stat ion cit les (two* in' Indiana, two' in the East) seem to arouse\nthe most rebellion to products, yetT in Table I people in these areas were\nreasonably average' in their reaction. The answer would seem to be that\nthere is no such thing -as an average 1 istener, any more than there is an\naverage two-, three-, or four-station town or city. As soon as individual\nlisteners are statistically broken apart into their separate replies or\nparts, ana added together again, a quite different composite emerges than\ncould be found in any one of the listeners questioned."
