  "text": "Workshop for National Agency\nStaff Members.\nThe publication is a session-by¬\nsession report of what actually took\nplace during the two-day period of\nthe Workshop, June 13-14, 1956,\nwhen 24 representatives of national\norganizations became students to\nlearn all they possibly could in that\nshort period about producing tele¬\nvision programs. The teachers\nwere drawn from networks, sta¬\ntions, institutions, and agencies in\nNew York. The facilities used\nwere those of New York Univer¬\nsity.\nThis 26-page mimeographed doc¬\nument costs 25 cents and can be se¬\ncured by writing to the Assembly\nat 345 East 46 Street, New York\n17.—Tracy F. Tyler.\n• • •\n• DEPARTMENT OF rectifica¬\ntion: cutline on page 26, January\nissue, should properly locate station\nKSLH in St. Louis not Denver.\nMusic Programming\nContinued from page 18\nthem in that order. This is not an\niron-clad rule, but in general the\nchronological idea is a good one.\nAfter you have your compositions\nselected, you will probably want to\nwrite some program notes. These\nshould be as clear and understand¬\nable and non-technical as possible.\nIt’s best to make these comments\nfairly short, and always interesting.\nOf course, you should see to it that\nall names are pronounced with the\nutmost care and accuracy. Faulty\npronunciation can ruin a music pro¬\ngram. There are written pronun¬\nciation guides which you can buy,\nand there’s also at least one disc on\nthe market that gives verbal pro¬\nnunciations of composers’ names\nand compositions.\nIt’s a good idea to have a book\nor two around that will give you\nbackground information on music\nand musicians. Baker’s Diction¬\nary of Music” is a good one, as is\nThompsons’ Encyclopedia of Music\nand Musicians.\nOnce you begin collecting your\nown LP’s, you have the problem of\nfiling them. We have found that the\nsimplest way for us is to take the\nrecords from their original jackets\nand put them into plain brown\nrecord sleeves. We number the\nrecords (and sleeves) consecutively,\nand file them without regard for\ncomposers’ names, titles, record\ncompanies, and such. All this lat¬\nter information is put on cards and\nfiled under several cross-indexes in\nsmall file drawers. If we want to\nfind a specific record, we go to\nFEBRUARY 1957\n25"
