The teacher is sometimes\nwith a viewing room group to as¬\nsist them in evaluating and analyz¬\ning the characteristics of the speak¬\ner. Individual speakers have the\nexperience of adapting their style\nof delivery to audiences ranging\nfrom the student cameramen and\nengineer to the entire class group\nof 70-90 and adjusting to rooms\nranging from studio size to the\nlarge assembly hall.\nOccasionally, the entire group\nmeets in the assembly hall for cer¬\ntain types of activity. Here the\ncamera is used as a magnifying\ndevice to provide clearer vision for\nthose in the rear of the room, to\ngive a close-up of a note-card, or\nto enlarge portions of a written\ncomposition for analysis. The en¬\ntire group meets thus for viewing\nkinescopes, movies, programs from\nthe local educational station, book\nreviews, library demonstrations, as¬\nsembly speakers, stagecraft demon¬\nstrations, and so forth.\nIn Unit B, the typewriting pro¬\nject is set up to test the effective¬\nness of closed circuit television as\nan instrument for enabling one\nteacher,, with a clerical assistant,\nto teach a large number of students\nin a skill subject. Two vidicon\ncameras are used by the teacher\nto transmit the lesson to an ad¬\njoining classroom while he is teach¬\ning a regular typing class. Stu¬\ndents in the viewing room watch the\nlesson on television and follow the\ndirections as given. A camera in\nthe receiving classroom enables the\nteacher to check on his monitor the\ndegree to which students in the\nviewing room have paced their ac¬\ntivity and to adjust his instruc¬\ntions accordingly. Students in the\nviewing room have a talk-back sys¬\ntem for asking questions.\nUnit C provides an informal ex¬\nperimental center where teachers\ntest and develop techniques before\ninitiating them into their regular\nclassroom procedures. A profes¬\nsional television engineer is present\nto help them check lighting, type of\ncamera shot, problems of focus, and\nso forth. Units of work in science,\nmathematics, English, foreign lan¬\nguage, and social studies can be pre¬\nsented here for analysis and evalu¬\nation by a small group, a faculty\ndepartment, or five classrooms of\nstudents.\n• SPECIAL projects are now be¬\ning developed to determine how\nmuch assistance closed circuit tele¬\nvision can provide in the areas of\nuniform testing, group counseling,\nregistration procedures, freshman\norientation, teacher training, new\nteacher orientation, and monitoring\ncertain supervisory situations. It is\nhoped that the experimentation in\nUnit C will lead to the discovery\nof effective teaching methods pe¬\nculiar to instruction by television\nand the improvement of instruc¬\ntion in traditional classroom orga¬\nnization.\nThe faculty and administration\nare approaching this experiment\nwith only one purpose: to improve\nthe quality of teaching.\nNOVEMBER 1956\n19"
