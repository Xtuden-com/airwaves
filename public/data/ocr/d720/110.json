This is particularly\ntrue with regard to the 80 VHF\nchannels, as yet largely untenanted,\nwhich are being eyed covetously by\ncommercial telecasters.\nInformation supplied by the FCC\nreveals that as of October, 1956,\nthere were 21 educational TV sta¬\ntions actually on the air with an¬\nother 22 stations authorized. Fur¬\nther study reveals that the licensees\nof these stations are largely wealthy\nmetropolitan school districts or\nheavily-endowed universities and\ncolleges. Apparently the initial\ncost of a standard television sta¬\ntion is well beyond the means of the\ntypical school district or educational\ninstitution, the capital outlay figure\nfor construction of a new station\nmost frequently mentioned in the\nJOURNAL being $200,000.\n• WITHIN THE last few months\nnew developments within the elec¬\ntronic industry, based on FCC ap¬\nproval of TV stations of 100-watts\nminimum power, have brought\nabout sweeping changes in our con¬\ncept of the costs of installing and\noperating an educational TV sta¬\ntion ; and it is now possible to put\na new station on the air for a figure\ndirectly comparable to the cost of a\nfully-equipped classroom in a mod¬\nem school building.\nMany well-known manufacturers\nof radio and electronic equipment,\ntaking advantage of economics re¬\nsulting from new production line\ntechniques, standardization of\nequipment design, and volume sales,\nare currently offering all the basic\nfacilities for a new 100-watt TV\nstation for a “package price” of ap¬\nproximately $35,000.\nThis, admittedly, would be a\nminimal installation, but would in¬\nclude an approved-type transmitter,\napproved-type monitor, c o a x ia 1\ntransmission line, and antenna.

Some firms even include\nbasic lighting equipment and film\nediting facilities within this $35,000\nfigure.\nLicensees of existing FM stations\nwould be able to use their present\nmicrophones, turntables, and audio\nconsole, thus reducing the required\ncapital outlay by at least $2,500.
