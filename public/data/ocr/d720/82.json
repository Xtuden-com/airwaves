The promising potentialities\noffered by the medium of television\nfor educational endeavor have been\nrecognized by the more far-sighted\neducators, along with some of the\ndangers that accompany the em¬\nbryonic growth of any new instru¬\nment that may be used to influence\nthe lives of people. Despite the\nfact that televiewing has increased\ntremendously in the past five or\nsix years, many schools seem to be\nmore concerned with the sociologi¬\ncal impact of TV than with the ex¬\ncellent use that can be made of the\nmedium for instructional purposes.\nEven though schools in general\nhave not, as yet, found it practical\nor possible to equip the various\nclassrooms with TV receivers, some\nguidance should be given to those\nstudents who have the opportunity\nto see television programs in their\nhomes. With the personal profit\nobtained from this source of in¬\nformation and entertainment, some\nof these gains can be transmitted to\nthe group through classroom dis¬\ncussions.\nWe shall need the perspective of\ntime to determine with any degree\nof accuracy, the impact of televi¬\nsion upon the lives of people, and\nespecially upon education. Mean¬\nwhile it will be necessary for those\nwho are interested in education by\ntelevision to seek partial answers\nthrough surveys and interviews, and\nto test by experimental program¬\nming the ways in which this new\nmedium may be used constructively\nfor educational purposes.
