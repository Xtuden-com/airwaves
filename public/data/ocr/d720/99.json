As\nenrollments increase in the years\nahead, there is danger of a widen¬\ning gap between the teacher and\nthe student. Here, then, may be\nanother place where TV can be\nused to good advantage as a supple¬\nmentary tool. By using the best\ninstructor in the department to do\nthe lectures via TV for all students\nin a given course and then using\nother available personnel to do la¬\nboratory, supervision, student coun¬\nselling, and grading, television can\nperhaps serve a useful purpose\nwith less strain on the instructional\nstaff, greater unity in subject\nmatter, and more effective teaching\nfor a greater number of students.\nTelevision in the classroom can\nnever take the place of the personal\nimpact of the student-teacher rela¬\ntionship and particularly the moti¬\nvation which results from class¬\nroom presentations and discussion.\nQuestions, quizzes, and recitations\nEducational TV\nhaving on school children; (6) all\n16 public and parochial schools in\nthe city were represented in the\nstudy; (7) the schools represented\nvarying socio-economic back¬\ngrounds; (8) all mental groups\nwere included—bright, dull, and\nnormal.\n• RESULTS and conclusions:\nPerhaps the most important result\nof this study has been the formation\nstill require the presence of teach¬\ners. While television may be used\nto make presentations to larger\nclasses, higher education cannot\nafford to deemphasize the personal\nelement, for this is the key to im¬\nparting understanding of subject\nmatter to students and the princi¬\npal means of bringing to bear upon\nthe students the personality of a\ngreat teacher, which is so important\nin individual development.\nTV will enrich courses, particu¬\nlarly those in such fields as drama,\nmusic, public speaking, and litera¬\nture. Moreover, it can be a great\nmedium for enriching the educa¬\ntion of the general public at the\nadult level. Both kinescope re¬\ncordings and live programs will\nbring to the public at large music\nby the great artists, plays with great\nactors, and discussions by lecturers\nof national prominence. In this\nway TV will raise the level of adult\neducation, community culture, and\nappreciation of better living.\nNeeds Research.\nContinued from page 12\nof the televiewing time pattern for\nboys and girls in each grade.\nIn order to determine just how\nboys and girls used the time they\nspent televiewing, it was necessary\nto do a close analysis of the diaries\nof each pupil in each grade for\neach day. From this analysis time\npatterns of viewing were developed\nfor each day and these patterns\nwere set up in the form of graphs.\nNOVEMBER 1956\n25"
