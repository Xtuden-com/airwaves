Only one male student indi¬\ncated the extreme in number of\nhours spent televiewing, recording\n45 hours for the week. Program\npreferences were well-balanced,\nwith variety shows, talent shows,\nand a strong preference for drama\nand music. Boys liked sports,\nnews, mystery, and drama, while\ngirls had a strong preference for\ndrama and music.\n10. Boys and girls from the\nfourth grade through the twelfth\nhad definite ideas why they liked\nprograms. They wanted programs\nto be interesting, entertaining, and\nexciting to a certain degree, as well\nas informational and educational.\nThe program must have variety and\naction, be realistic to some extent,\nand above all, be well written, well\ndirected and enacted.\n11. The boys and girls in grades\nnine through 12 did little, if any,\nteleviewing on Friday and Saturday\nevening. They preferred dances,\ndates, movies, parties, night games,\nplays, concerts, school functions,\nand other activities.\n12. Only 10 per cent of all boys\nand girls in the twelve grades re¬\nported televiewing alone, while 90\nper cent televiewed with one or\nmore other persons.\n13. Fifty-one per cent of boys\nand girls in grades four through\ntwelve reported some of the better\nwritten, better directed and enacted\ntelevision programs had been help¬\nful to them in school subjects- They\njustified this belief with well\nthought out responses explaining\nhow these programs had been help¬\nful. Fourteen different subjects\nwere listed by students who felt\nthey had been helped in some way\nby the content of 43 different pro¬\ngrams mentioned.\n14. Junior and senior high\nschool students wanted more dra¬\nmatic programs about things they\nwere required to read and study in\ntheir school subjects. They wanted\nmore dramatized news and special\nevents. They felt it would stimu¬\nlate interest to read more in the\nvarious fields of subject matter\nthat are presented on TV.\n15. Seventy-four per cent of\nthe boys and girls in grades four\nthrough 12 indicated they had learn¬\ned to do several new things after\nwatching TV programs. They list¬\ned dress designing, training and\ncare of pets, new dance steps,\nmagic, how to take good pictures,\nhow to draw, and many others\nwhich suggested that certain pro¬\ngrams do offer worthwhile results.\n16. A majority of the students\nselected television as first choice of\nfive media because it combined all\nthe good qualities of all the other\nmedia. Books followed as second\nchoice primarily because they were\naccessible, could be read at will,\nread over again, and because they\nlet a person use the imagination.\nRadio placed third and movies\nfourth. Comic books appeared as\na poor fifth.
