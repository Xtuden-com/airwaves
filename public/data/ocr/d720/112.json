  "text": "of a year or so ago is the use of\nvidicon tubes in both the camera and\nfilm chain. A comparatively new\ndevelopment, vidicon tubes are con¬\nsiderably less expensive to purchase\nand operate than either the icono¬\nscope or image orthicon types, and\nare also less subject to damage by\ninexperienced operators. They have\nan excellent gray range from white\nto black, and are capable of sharp,\ncrisp pictures with fine detail.\nApparently the initial\ncost of a standard TV sta¬\ntion has been beyond the\nmeans of the typical school\ndistrict.\nThey do, however, require a\nsomewhat greater level of light in¬\ntensity for proper operation. The\neducational telecaster may meet this\nproblem simply by concentrating his\nefforts on relatively small sets\nwhere the required light intensity\nis readily obtained, and avoiding\nlarge studio productions until such\ntime as he is financially able to pur¬\nchase additional lighting equipment.\nThe advantages of such a low-\npower approach to educational tele¬\nvision are entirely obvious. Many\neducational agencies can immedi¬\nately construct such a station, or¬\nganize and train a staff, and at the\nsame time provide a new educa¬\ntional television service for their\ncommunity. When additional funds\ncan be spared, the present trans¬\nmitter can be used to drive a high-\npower amplifier stage for increased\npower output with a substantial re¬\nsultant increase in station cover¬\nage. Most important of all, the re¬\nserved channel for that community\nwill be in use, insuring its per¬\nmanent allocation to education.\n• HOWEVER, BEFORE we\ncompletely embrace the idea of low-\npower TV, it would be wise to ex¬\namine critically just what it can ac¬\ncomplish for education. More\nspecifically, how large a “class¬\nroom,” or viewing audience, will it\nsatisfactorily serve ? Only when we\nhave compiled this information are\nwe in a position to justify the ex¬\npenditure of public funds for a new\nstation.\nTaking Eugene, Oregon, as a\ntypical potential community for edu¬\ncational television since it already\nhas two educational FM broadcast\nstations, KRVM and KWAX, with\nmany years of successful operation,\nit was decided to undertake a pre¬\nliminary engineering study of the\ncoverage to be obtained with a sta¬\ntion of 100 watts effective radiated\npower(ERP), and with an effective\nantenna height of 100 feet, opera-\nIt is now possible to\nhave a station for the cost\nof a fully-equipped class¬\nroom in a modern school\nbuilding.\nting on the local educational alloca¬\ntion, Channel 9.\nUsing propagation data based on\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
