We may\ndecry the apathy of the thousands\nof teachers who, regardless of the\nattempts made to show them the\npriceless reservoir of effective\nteaching materials possessed by\nradio and television, continue to\nteach as they were taught, no mat¬\nter how long ago that was. A more\ncareful investigation will frequently\nreveal that these non-users of ra¬\ndio and television, are also non¬\nusers of most of the other modem\ntools. How many of them make\nlearning easier for their pupils by\nconstructing or securing models or\nmock-ups to better explain con¬\ncepts about an object than mere\nverbalization could possibly\nachieve ? How many use motion\npictures, or if they do, use them\neffectively? How many use photo¬\ngraphs, slides, film strips, and so\nforth ? How many, even though they\nschedule a so-called “field trip,”\nactually work out with their pupils\nahead of time, the key ideas to be\nexplored so that each pupil will\nrespond both physically and mental¬\nly to the new situation?\nOnly a few modern teaching de¬\nvices have been mentioned, but the\nproblem should be clear: Good\nteaching requires intelligence, imag¬\nination, determination, and a love of\nboth children and the subjects be¬\ning taught. Many teachers possess\nall of these attributes in generous\nmeasure. Unfortunately, the major¬\nity do not. But the situation is not\nhopeless. The schools have better\nteachers today than ever befofe.\nAnd, as time goes on, their number\nwill increase.\nThe solution to extending the use\nof educational radio and television\nlies in better selection of those in¬\ndividuals permitted to enter teacher\ntraining institutions, better prepara¬\ntion of those selected, a requirement\nfor further study in modem teach¬\ning tools by teachers now in serv¬\nice, and a continued promotion,\nthrough effective demonstration, of\nthe ways in which educational ra¬\ndio and television programs can\nmake the teacher’s efforts more\nproductive.\nOnly when all of us work to this\nend, will every boy and girl in\nAmerican schools be served as well\neducationally by radio and television\nas he is now being entertained by\nthese same media.-Tracy F. Tyler,\nEditor.\nNOVEMBER 19:56"
