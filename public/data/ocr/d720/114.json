Y. 227 pages plus 3-page index, illustrated 6x9\n$4.95 paper bound.\n• THIS BOOK is primarily a\ntechnical book. Its purpose is to\n“present information about closed\ncircuit television systems available\nand to suggest some of the ways\nin which such systems can serve\nmodern needs.” In the opening\nchapter, the author describes a\nnumber of services which are al¬\nready being performed by closed\ncircuit television and describes\nmany practical examples. To those\nwho contemplate the use of closed\ncircuit television in a business or in¬\ndustrial plant, we suggest that this\nfirst chapter is required reading.\nPerhaps it might be well to quote\na definition from the book. “Closed\ncircuit television is simpler and\nless expensive than broadcast tele¬\nvision, since it consists basically\nonly of a camera, a power supply,\na pulse generator, and a viewer.\nSince the signal in closed circuit\nsystems is ordinarily carried from\nthe camera to the viewer by wire,\nseveral complicated and costly steps\nof broadcast television are avoid¬\ned.”\nThe remainder of the book is\nquite technical and is primarily for\nengineers or technicians only. The\nbasic systems of picture transmis¬\nsion are described, beginning with\nthe principles and capabilities of\nthe system. The scanning process\nis covered in detail followed by\na full treatment of camera tubes\nand circuits. The author covers\nfully the characteristics of the vid-\nicon, the electrostatic iconoscope,\nthe image dissector, and the vericon\nwhich are used by various manu¬\nfacturers of closed circuit indus¬\ntrial television equipment.\n• VIDEO amplifier systems are\nnext treated with methods employ¬\ned for high and low frequency com¬\npensation, and phase correction.\nThe use of the cathode follower,\nhigh peaker. D-C reinsertion and\nbrightness control are covered.\nThe theory and operation of the\nsynchronizing generator is fully ex¬\nplained with features of the opera¬\ntion of interlaced and non inter¬\nlaced generators outlined and pre¬\nsented in detail. The operation of\nthe RCA interlaced sync genera¬\ntor for use with the Vidicon camera\ntube is given in detail including\nschematics. Its vertical and hori-\nContinued on page 27\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
