Pro¬\ngrams covered a wide range of to¬\npics — science and industry, music\nand dance, arts and drama, history,\nnational and world affairs, psych¬\nology, literature and philosophy,\nnews and current events, community\nand state affairs, farm and agri¬\nculture, religion, home and gar¬\nden, public health and safety.\nSixty per cent of total telecast\ntime was devoted to live programs.\nKinescope recordings account for\n21 per cent of program time. Film\nrepresented 19 per cent of the time\non the air.\n• • •\n• A SECOND television station\nbegan broadcasting August 15 in\nKorea.\nTest broadcasts began May 12,\n1956. In the beginning, 50 TV\nsets were set up in the streets\nof Seoul so that the largest num¬\nber of citizens could view the\nprograms.\nRegular broadcasting began June\nfirst. The station, HLKZ, is owned\nby the Korea RCA Distributors\nCorporation. When regular broad¬\ncasting began, 300 TV receivers\nhad been made available by RCA.\nFifty were placed in railway sta¬\ntions, schools, churches, and other\npublic places; 250 were available\nfor purchase.\n• • •\n• A FORD Foundation grant makes\nit possible for Chatham College,\nPittsburgh, to have a three-state\ncampus this year — reaching into\nOhio and West Virginia as well as\nPennsylvania.\n• • •\n• WKNO-TV of Memphis, new\neducational station, begins a full-\nscale “reading and writing” course\nvia Channel 10. The 30 half-hour\nprograms in the series are aimed at\nsome 50,000 people of the Memphis\narea. A special “Literacy Week”\nlaunched the program.\n• • •\n• THREE MILLION visitors\nview WTTW, Chicago, each year—\nat least this is the number who come\nto the Museum of Industrial Arts\nand Sciences in which the studios,\na ready-made, continuing exhibit,\nare located. The station as part of\nits regular programming takes a\npicture of spectators through the\nwindows of its studios.\nNOVEMBER 1956\n21"
