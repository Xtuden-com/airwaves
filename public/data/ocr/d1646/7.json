We have extended the post office facili¬\nties to the remotest hamlet, and we have kept that line of communication open\neven at great expense. We have declared that telephone and telegraph shall be\npublic utilities for the general service of the American public.\nNow, here comes something that is more universal, more potent than any of\nthese, communication by the human voice to young and old, literate and illiterate\nalike, and instantaneously over the entire nation. We must preserve this new\ninstrument because of its great possibilities in American life.\nWe have safeguarded the freedom of speech in the press where we permit abuses\nrather than place the slightest danger of censorship upon the press, and through\nthe multiplicity of newspapers her^, there, and yonder, we find assurance that the\ntruth will get out. We contend that in this plan of radio broadcasting—private,\npublic, and local broadcasting stations—we have a diversity which offers similar\nsecurity.\nHere is our proposal in outline form:\n’’The National Committee on Education by Radio, concluding four years\nof study and investigation, recommeends to the President, the Congress, and\nto the people of the United States a plan for an American system of radio\nbroadcasting to serve the welfare of the American people.\n’’The people of the United States shall establish a broadcasting system\nto supplement but not to supplant the present private system, and to make\navailable to American listeners programs free from advertising and presenting\nentertainment and information to promote public welfare. Such supplemental\npublic system should meet as far as practicable the following' specifications:\n’’The management of such public broadcasting system, including the deter¬\nmination of program policies, shall be vested in a series of boards—national,\nregional, and state—with suitable powers to insure service to both national\nand local needs. These boards should be nonpartisan, the members carefully\nselected from leaders active in fields of public welfare, such as agriculture,\nlabor, music, drama, schools, religion, science, medicine, law, the arts,\nand other civic interests. It is suggested that appointments to the national\nboard and to the regional boards be made by the President of the United\nStates, confirmed by the United States Senate, and to the state boards by the\nrespective governors, in all cases the appointments to be from lists of eligible\npersons nominated by the supreme courts of the several states.\n(MORE)"
