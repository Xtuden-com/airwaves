  "text": "-10-\n\"Night Flight” is a student-oriented program. We communicate with\noff-campu3 and dormitory students by giving them announcements of\ncampus events and the music they want (within reason and the bounds\nof good taste).. We reason that in this community the audience after\n11:00 P.M. is primarily students, anyway, and a variety of popular\nmusic is played with announcements in a dine jockey format.\nWGLT, carrier-current, is on the air from 6:30 to 9:00 A.M.\nMonday through Saturday and beginning at 3:00 P.M. daily. From 6:00\nP„K. to sign-off the carrier-current and PM are simulcast for students\nin the dormitories who do not have FM receivers. Those who have FM\nsets, of course, get a better signal.\nA great deal of progress has been made with radio at ISU. We have\nplane to do much more with it.\n1. We are preparing to offer more course work leading to a major\nin radio-TV in the Speech Department.\n2. We are investigating the potential of daytime instructional\nradio for the schools in the community. The local school\nboards have, so far, been reluctant to use ETV, and we hope\nto \"break the ice” with radio and lead to full and effective\nuse of educational broadcasting.\n3. We hope to find ways and means of broadcasting during the summer\nmonths and holidays.\n4. We are discussing the potential of sub-channels for use on the\ncampus and in the community.\ni"
