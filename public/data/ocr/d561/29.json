WGLT-FM is still \"owned\" by the University\nwith partial support from student funds. WGLT, carrier-current, is\nstill the preliminary training-ground for students, but the FM staff is\nalso composed of trainees.\nFM programing is also an extension of carrier-current; however, the\nWGLT program schedule has always included a variety of programs--all\ntypes of music programmed for listening plus discussion of local issues\nby students, faculty, and townspeople; live and taped coverage of campus\nand local events from sports to visiting lecturers and performers; stu¬\ndent-produced features including some drama; and tapes of both entertain¬\nment and information from the United Nations, the State Department, BFA,\nIBS, and foreign broadcast sources. To the basic carrier-current sche¬\ndule we have added programs from the National Educational Radio Network\n(NAEB) and special programs are devoted to the promotion and coverage\nof local events of .interest to both the campus and the community.\nThe FM program schedule, 7 evenings totaling 51 hours per week,\nbegins with general information and light but listenable music from\n6:00 to 8:00 P.M. An appreciative and devoted audience has already been\nestablished for \"classical\" music from 8:00 to 10:00 each evening. News,\ndiscussion and music are scheduled from 10:00 to 11:00 P0M0 All public\nservice and promotional announcements up to 11:00 P.M. are of interest\nto the entire coramunity. From 11:00 to sign-off (1:00 A.M. Monday\nthrough Friday mornings and 2:00 A.M. Saturday and Sunday mornings)"
