Yet in the field of commercial broadcasting,\nthis is rarely the case. The nature of the commercial enterprise\nseems to necessitate an appeal to a mass audience and therefore\nit is almost impossible, to make adequate provision for limited\nand exceptional audiences.\nFor these reasons the Minnesota Private Colleges have\nindorsed a plan to establish a state network of FM radio\nstations. This plan calls for class \"C\" stations in the follow¬\ning areas:\nDuluth\nMoorhead\nCollegeville — KSJR — 90.1 me"
