State assistance, or a combination of these plus available\neducational grants from national or industrial foundations 0\nIn approaching stage two, which is to effect a state-wide network of\nradio stations, it must be possible to transmit signals from one station\nwhich can be received by a second station, and in turn, transmitted to a\nthird station, and so on, until the signal has been distributed and\nreceived in every area of the state*\nThis may be accomplished in one of three ways:\n1* told line connections\n2 * Microwave connections\n3* System of high power transmitting stations *"
