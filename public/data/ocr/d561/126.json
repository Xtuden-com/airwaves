  "text": "The land line system has some advantages but will prove quite costly\non an annual lease basis or outright purchase and maintenance*\nMicrowave installations, in the number required to cover the state\n(with low power stations) also would prove costly both in original cost\nand maintenance categories*\nThe third system, although presenting an original cost of some\nproportions, eliminates connecting expense, and provides complete coverage\nof practically every area of the state *\nTwo important factors are inherent in this latter system» The\nstrategically located stations are conceived as having an effective\nradiated power output of 5>0-kilowatts, transmitting from a height to\novercome existing terrain obstacles* A sufficient number of stations\nwould be able to pick up the signal from its nearest neighbor*\nThe second feature of this system is that each station would be\nequipped for multiplexing signals* Multiplexing, or the ability to\nbroadcast simultaneously three (or more) radio programs from a single\ntransmitter, is a unique feature of FM. In simplest terms, this refers\nto a main channel (available) to any FM receiving set), and two (or more)\nsub-channels, available only to special receivers capable of decoding the\nsub-channel signals* The main channel would be employed to care for its\nown coverage area; one side band would be employed to carry network programs;\nthe other side band could be employed for feeding the network, serving a\nregional network, closed-circuit communication such as a \"conference call,\"\nfor in-school listening with its local coverage area* Using the main\nchannel and one of the sub-channels, listeners could enjoy true \"stereo\"\nbroadcasts*\nOther uses of these sub-channels (without interfering with the\nprimary signal) include mazy non-broadcast oriented services* One such\nuse is the exchange of important information from computer, library or\nresearch centers (as projected in national plans evolved by MAES), re¬\ntraining programs, intra-area professional \"roundtables*\" As explained\npreviously, any utilisation of these sub-channels would require receiving\nsets capable of decording the sub-channel signals*\nObviously, the first task is to determine - based on sound engineering\ntests - the placing of these strategically located high power stations®•«\nit is scarcely possible that communities would welcome a second demand\nfor contributions to underwrite establishment of these stations - since\nthey are being or will be asked to support existing or planned television\nstations* Therefore, it is suggested that these stations be located -\nwhere feasible « at institutions of higher learning* These conceivably\nwould be in a better position to provide a staff of more advanced maturity\nthan could reasonably be expected from a school system* These institutions\nwould also make good use of the high power stations for projecting their\nown image Into their coverage area®"
