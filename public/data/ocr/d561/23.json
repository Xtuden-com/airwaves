The larger the\nstation, the less chance can be taken with unproven talent—per¬\nformers, writers, producers with Ideas.\n3. Networks and production centers will enable us to provide a\nvariety of educational programs* Such facilities would allow us\nto produce many instructional programs more efficiently both in\nterms of production costs as well as in the use of resources and\ntalent. Bach community, however, has special needs. Differences\nbetween regions of the country and from community to community\n\\\ndemand different lesson content and teaching approaches. The\nquestion of \"local control\" is not just a matter of States*\nRights politics; it is a very real educational need.\nFor example, a fins series of lessons has been produced in\nNew York designed to teach primary grade youngsters how to listen.\nBut the sounds they are told to listen for are city sounds; the\nteacher and the Btudents for whom the programs are produced are\nurban and \"eastern\" in their total orientation. The program idea,\nbasic teaching techniques, and production are excellent. Mid¬\nwestern youngsters born in small towns or on the farm would find\nmost of the sounds strange, however, including the New York speech\nof the teacher. National, regional, and state networks can con¬\ntribute much of value to education, but they cannot do the entire\njob. There is a place for the low-power station serving one large\ncommunity or groups of closely related smaller ones."
