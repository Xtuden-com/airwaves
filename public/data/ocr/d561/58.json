W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Mr. Sandler:\nThank you for your memorandum dated November 25, 1966. We at WECI are\nof course very concerned about this matter and we are preparing our\ncomments to the FCC.\nHowever, since so many stations which are limited in resources are involved,\nwe feel that more must be done. We have found in our investigations that\nmany stations have not even been informed of the proposals in Docket No.\n14185. No less a party than the school of Television and Radio at\nMichigan State University was overlooked by the FCC in its mailing, as\nwas WECI. I have sent to the FCC for a copy and recieved it, though.\nBut the point I am making is that the Commission appears to be railroading\nthis through, consulting as few people as possible, and going through\nthe motions of requesting comments only because they are required by law.\nMy urgent suggestion to NAEB is that you immediately retain an attorney\nin Washington to see what can be done. I am now trying to organize the\nten-watt stations in Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, and Kentucky for this\nporpose, and I have urged the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System to do\nthe same* This battle will take a lot of combined effort.\nIf possible, I would like to have a copy of your national allocation table.\nSincerely,\n1.-,\nStation Manager"
