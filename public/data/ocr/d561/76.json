In future\nyears interconnections could be made between the educational FM\nnetwork in Minnesota and those of surrounding states, which\nwould provide a still greater range of program sources and\ndistribution.\nAn FM station would provide the University and other Twin\nCity educational groups with an evening radio outlet, something\nimpossible with the University present AM facility. The most\nfrequent question asked by KQOM listeners throughout the years\nhas been, ‘’Why donJt you broadcast in the evening?” As pointed\nout above, the sunset sign-off requirement means that KUOM can\nnever broadcast later than 9s00 p.m., and in mid-winter must sign-\noff at 4s30. In addition to limiting the hours available, the\nrequirement for irregular sign-offs poses the difficulty of building\naudiences for programs available during only a few months each year.\nFurthermore, the latest hours are in the summertime, when the audience\nfor serious material is not as large as during the winter.\nAdditional time would make it possible to both extend and enrich\nK0OM*s services. At present there are not enough hours for much\navailable material, such as lectures, seminars, and concerts."
