INQUIRE\nThe Executive Committee of Duquesne University of Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, licensee for Radio Broadcating Station >DUQ,\n91.5 mc/s, Channel 218, with transmitter rated at 1 kw, and an\nERP of 2,75 hw, concurs in the suggestion contained in the matter of\n\"Revision of FM Broadcast Rules, Particularly as to Allocation and\nTechnical Standards (Educational FM Channels\", Docket No.lUl85>'\nFederal Communications Commission.\nAlthough Channels 201 through 220 (88.1 through 91.9 mc/s) have\nbeen reserved/for educational broadcasting use, there has been,\nunfortunately, a tendency at some educational institutions which\nseemingly fail to develop the awareness of the pedagogic and cultural\npotential of this instrument of \"mass\" communication, to treat the\nacquisition of a broadcasting license with less than the sense of\nprofound responsibility such an instrunent implies.\nInstead of being content with a multiplicity of lowepower,\nsometimes ineffectual operations, use of multiplexing and\nrealistic power should stimulate multiple educational institutions\nin an area to cooperate in maintaining a single installation at\nsome easily accessable location. Thus, the sub-channels could be\nutilized for direct instruction, where desired, while the main\nchannel remains free for programs beamed to the local community.\nSchool systems, public or private, which have made a practice\nof utilizing a radio frequency for direct teaching exclusively\nand only during school hours, should be. required in the public\ninterest, to provide Informative, cultural and infortation broadÂ¬\ncasting for gene, ul audiences during the evening hours."
