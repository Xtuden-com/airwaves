Soma channels, perhaps only 1 or 2P reserved exclusively\nfor 10 watt stations licensed to serve legitimate local\nneeds, (Local needs would have to be defined and all 10\nv;att stations encouraged to provide a real service.)\n3. Some channels reserved for licensees who could begin as\n10 watt stations and increase to a set maximum power as\nlocal conditions and needs allow or demand. (Perhaps within\na given time limit such as one or two 3-year license periods).\nB. Careful study should be made of hours on the air and program\nrequirements for 10 watt stations to assure that such stations will\nbe educational. A minimum number of broadcast hours per week\n(perhaps 40 to 50) should be required of all 10 watt licensees but\nwith provision for no broadcasts during school holidays.\nC. Network affiliation of all educational stations (AM, PM, TV and\nat whatever power) will have to be carefully planned with provisions\nfor all stations to serve cooperatively in meeting educational needs\nat all levels.\nThe results of any changes in allocation and assignment of\neducational FM channels should be an improved total effectiveness\nof educational broadcasting in every coimunity and school. Surely\nan equitable means of assigning these channels can be devised that\nwill allow and encourage the development of network educational\nradio as a national resource and, at the 3ame time, preserve and\nencourage the kinds of services which can best be performed by\nlow-power local stations. The Commission has constantly stressed\nthe responsibility of all broadcasters to provide local service.\nV"
