Some\nof their decisions and discussions have been\nreported in separate items in the News¬\nletter; others are presented here. The Board\nwill meet again on October 22 in Kansas\nCity, and in the spring of 1967, in Wash¬\nington.\n• NAEB financial status. The Board re¬\nviewed and accepted a report by Arthur\nYoung and Company, national accounting\nconsultant firm, calling for realignment of\nthe NAEB’s fiscal structure and new book¬\nkeeping methods to take into account its\ncomplex division structure. The report\nshowed specific calculations of a deficit that\nhad been accumulating over a period of\nyears, and the Board authorized the staff to\ntake steps to alleviate the deficit by means\nof a bank loan and solicitation of special\ngifts. The deficit comes from the need to\nalign calendar-year and fiscal-year account¬\ning procedures, and does not affect the an¬\nnual budgets, which have been in balance\nover the past several years.\nThe Board approved a draft budget for\n1966-67, subject to revisions that will be\nmade following approval of division bud¬\ngets and final review by the Executive Com¬\nmittee.\n• Convention and conferences. The Board\nrecommended a move to schedule annual\nconventions more regularly in Washington\nand Chicago after 1970. (In 1966 the con¬\nvention will be in Kansas City, 1967 in\nDenver, and 1968, 1969, and 1970 conven¬\ntions will all be in Washington.)\nThe Board received a report that the\npresident has appointed a committee to con¬\nsider a closer relationship -between the spring\nregional meetings and the annual conven¬\ntion, as well as the need for more effective\nliaison with meetings affecting educational\nradio and TV conducted by other associa¬\ntions.\n• Research and development. The Board\napproved the principle of apportioning over¬\nhead funds from NAEB projects to\nstrengthen the Office of Research and De¬\nvelopment. The intent is to provide a more\nadequate staff to conduct projects which the\nNAEB is called upon to handle, so that the\ngeneral staff does not have to spend an in¬\nordinate amount of time on such activities.\nWASHINGTON, D.C.\nFULBRIGHT GRANTS\nPersons interested in research or lecture¬\nship grants for 1967-68 should write now\nfor information and application forms to:\nCommittee on International Exchange of\nPersons, Conference Board of Associated\nResearch Councils, 2101 Constitution Ave¬\nnue, Washington, D.C. 20418.\nIMD Votes Dues Increase\nThe NAEB Individual Member Division\ndirectors, meeting in New York in April,\nvoted to increase individual-member dues to\n$15 as of July 1, 1966. The additional $5\nwill go to the division, to provide better\nservice to members—especially to the pro¬\nfessional interest sections. This is the first\nincrease in Individual Member dues in sev¬\neral years.\nUnder the new arrangement, NAEB Vice\nPresident Harold Hill will devote part of\nhis time to coordinating the activities of the\nprofessional interest sections, developing\ngreater personal contact with IMD mem¬\nbers to learn what services they desire, and\nplanning IMD sessions at NAEB area meet¬\nings, to serve professional interests of mem¬\nbers in their own geographic regions.\n• Dues of NAEB institutional members\nwill be increased by 30 per cent on July 1,\n1966, as approved by the NAEB Board of\nDirectors in New York.\nNewsletter to Move\nEffective with the August issue, the\nNAEB Newsletter will be written in the\nheadquarters office in Washington, rather\nthan in the publications office in Urbana.\nAfter June 20, members should send ma¬\nterial for the Newsletter to: Newsletter\nEditor, NAEB, 1346 Connecticut Avenue,\nN.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.\nThe NAEB Journal will still be edited in\nthe Urbana office.\nWrong Applications for\nETV Facilities Aid\nStaffers of the ETV Facilities Program\nreport that they are still receiving new ap¬\nplications on the old yellow-covered appli¬\ncation form. Applicants who wish to avoid\ndelays in processing should use the green-\ncovered form which replaced the old one in\nthe fall of 1964. Copies may be obtained\nfrom: ETV Facilities Program, Office of\nEducation, HEW, 400 Maryland, S.W.,\nWashington, D.C. 20202.\nJUNE, 1966\nWitherspoon to Leave\nECS Post in Fall\nJohn Witherspoon, director of the Edu¬\ncational Communications System Study, will\nleave the NAEB staff in September to join\nthe Brooks Foundation, Santa Barbara,\nCalif., as associate director for telecommu¬\nnication. James S. Miles, director of radio-\nTV at Purdue University, will take over\nthe ECS project as acting director.\nThe changeover in command will coin¬\ncide with the end of the project’s third\nphase, in which three model systems—intra¬\nstate, interstate, and “educational resources”\n—are being set up. Phase IV will demon¬\nstrate the system.\nETS Recommends\nChanges in Facilities Act\nIn a report recently compiled at the re¬\nquest of Senator Warren G. Magnuson,\nchairman of the Interstate Commerce Com¬\nmittee, NAEB’s TV Division asks for sev¬\neral changes in the ETV Facilities Act.\nAmong them is the request that the one-\nmillion-dollar-per-state ceiling be raised, to\nallow full development of ETV in the\nstates prepared to use it.\nThe report names 12 states—Alabama,\nCalifornia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Ken¬\ntucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska,\nNew York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania—which\nhave already reached the one-million mark\nand thus are not eligible for additional fed¬\neral funds, while two states have not at¬\ntempted to use any funds under the act,\nand several others require substantially less.\nThe report also recommends a matching\nformula of 75% federal and 25% local\nfunds, instead of the present 50-50; and\nthat unlimited use of the funds for inter¬\nconnection be allowed.\nAll ETV stations in the country were\nquestioned, and the report is based on their\nresponses.\nWin Ohio State Awards\nSeven educational stations were among\nthe 1966 Ohio State Award winners an¬\nnounced May 19 in Columbus. There were\n22 TV and 23 radio winners from a total\nof 565 entries. Among them were: WHA-\nTV, University of Wisconsin, for “Speech\nCorrection: Impaired Motor Coordination” ;\nKLRN-TV, University of Texas, for “Na-\n1"
