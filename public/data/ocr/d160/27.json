If we add to this anticipated deficit of $16,000 the\n$13,000 already advanced to the Individual Member Division and\nthe Instruction Division, our actual operating cash position as\nof June 30 would be nearly $30,000 short of requirements*.\nIn order to avoid borrowing from divisions or projects,\nwe have explored the possibility of a bank loan to take care of\nthis cash shortage until a plan that will be reviewed at the\nmeeting can bring us additional revenue. We shall cover not only\nthe matter of a deficit, but also the need to build up the reserve\nfor known contingencies such as increased rent and possible change\nin location.\nOur bank has indicated a willingness to lend us money only\non a short term basis (60-90 days) unless the loan is secured.\nSince we always have advance funds from projects and divisions\ninvested in Certificates of Deposit, the bank has suggested that\nwe use a $30,000 Certificate of Deposit as collateral for a\n$30,000 loan at 6 per cent interest, the repayment of which can be\non any basis we desire. To retire this loan, interest and repayment\nof principle could be budgeted over the next five or six years or\nlonger.\nWe have a proposal, however, which hopefully would permit\nus to repay the entire loan within the next year. The Executive\nStaff will discuss in detail at the Executive Committee meeting a\nrecommendation that the Association mount an intensive campaign\nto raise $30,000 in the next 12 months."
