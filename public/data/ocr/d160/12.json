The buildings listed* which are merely examples of what might\nbe available, vary in size* location* need for reparis* etc, * but they will\nstill provide some rough information for purposes of consideration. Actually*\nin some of the larger buildings which might be acquired* it might be possible\nto rent out quite a bit of .space to ethers*\nNo buildings have yet been investigated* because it was felt that to do so\nwould be a waste of time until the Beard reacted to this proposal*\nRecommendation\nIt is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the staff to explore\nthoroughly the possibilities of purchasing a building in Washington to the\nNAEB 3 It is further recommended that the Board authorize the Executive\nCommittee to act with full authority in the matter of accruiring any such\nbuilding* should the Executive Committee feel that such a purchase is\nadvisable after full exploration by the staff."
