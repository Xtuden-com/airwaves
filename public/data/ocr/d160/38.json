  "text": "Convention and Conferences\nTwo steps have been taken to develop a more comprehensive policy\nwith respect to the NAEB Convention and the various conferences which the\nAssociation sponsors or hosts throughout the year. The staff has studied\nthis matter at several staff meetings and has developed some tentative\nguidelines. In addition, the President is appointing a special task force,\nmade of representatives from various segments of the membership, to work\nwith two or three staff members in developing an overall policy for our\nconferences,\nThe staff meetings I mentioned have resulted in the identification\nOr\" %\nfo /ix major areas of concern which we feel might serve as a basis for\nplanning the content of our various meetings. These six are 1) Legislation,\nand its effect on educational broadcasting; 2) Changing patterns in\neducation and the role of communications in education of the future;\n3) Motivation, or how we influence people, and thus the role of communica¬\ntions in this area; 4) Changing technology and the interrelated use of the\nvarious communications media; 5) Personnel advancement - both pre-service\nand in-service training of educational broadcasting personnel, including\nrecruitment; 6) Community service, with emphasis on how educational\nbroadcasters can become a part of community life and play an important\nrole therein. As we discuss the tentative outline for this fall's conven¬\ntion in a few minutes, you'll see that the program has been built around\nsome of the above topics. The others are perhaps better suited for\ndevelopment at smaller meetings. In this way, we hope to coordinate the\nmeetings so as to sort out activities appropriate to various meetings,\nand also, by using the thematic approach, be able to treat major topics\nin depth by having smaller meetings follow through and reinforce discussions\ninitiated at the national convention."
