Therefore, we have attempted\nto establish a realistic base for fiscal 1966-67 in light of the\nproblems already discussed.\nIncrease in Dues\nContinuing at a reduced staff level and paring other\nexpenses, we can balance our budget and provide for a modest\nsurplus at the end of the year if we increase institutional dues.\nTwo alternatives for accomplishing this will be presented at the\nmeeting.\nSuch an increase is not deemed by the staff to be merely\nan expedient in the present crisis, but is considered a logical\nstep, long contemplated, toward more realistic self-support. In\nrecent years, we have been able to survive only because each year\nwe have realized between $40,000 and $50,000 in overhead from\nprojects. This is not a realistic basis for a sound fiscal\npolicy. The shortages we have had just this year due to the reÂ¬\norganization of USOE support this argument.\nThe staff feels that the only firm fiscal basis upon which\nwe can operate is to provide for adequate income through\nrelatively fixed sources: dues, sale of publications, convention,\nand other miscellaneous sources, and not rely on project overhead."
