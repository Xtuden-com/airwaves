  "text": "Summer TV Institutes for High School Students\nHundreds of high school students each\nsummer spend vacations studying at TV\ninstitutes sponsored by colleges or univer¬\nsities. To investigate the extent and nature\nof these institutes, I mailed a questionnaire\nto colleges or universities which were\nknown for their broadcasting activities\nand/or had strong course offerings in\nbroadcasting.\nI received 46 (90%) replies out of 51\nquestionnaires mailed in November 1964.\nOf the respondents, 19 (41%) offered a\nhigh school institute, 10 of them in tele¬\nvision. (Other areas mentioned were 10\ninstitutes in speech, including public speak¬\ning, general communications, debate, and\noral interpretation; 11 in drama; 10 in ra¬\ndio; 2 in newspaper journalism; 1 audio¬\nvisual workshop; and a combination music,\nFrench, and fine arts workshop.)\nThere were TV institutes on the cam¬\npuses of these universities: Michigan\nState, Montana State, Northwestern, Ohio\nState, Denver, Kansas, Nebraska, the Pa¬\ncific, Southern California, and Washing¬\nton State. Length of the institutes varied\nfrom two to six weeks, averaging four\nweeks.\nAll institutes charged tuition, with fees\nranging from $25 to $130, not including\nroom and board. The median tuition fee\nwas $75, while the mean was $45. Half of\nthe TV institutes received college-appro¬\npriated funds in addition to tuition fees.\nEnrollment requirements included the\nstudent’s rank in class (upper fourth to\nupper third) ; completion of grade 10; rec¬\nommendation from a speech teacher, jour¬\nnalism teacher, or principal; results of\ncollege entrance exams; and a good record\nin high school journalism, speech, science\nand mathematics or group leadership ac¬\ntivities. Northwestern University’s Nation¬\nal High School Institute, in its thirty-fifth\nyear, had the most stringent requirements.\nTelevision institutes admitted from 11 to\n40 students, averaging 20.\nEach institute offered formal lectures\non broadcasting — with five institutes\n—by Donald G. Kirkorian\nspending no more than a quarter of the\ntime on lectures, three spending from a\nquarter to half the time, and one spend¬\ning from half to three quarters of the\ntime in this manner. One respondent could\nnot answer this question, as lecture time\nvaried with change of instructor. Two in¬\nstitutes used textbooks to supplement lec¬\ntures, one having a bibliography for stu¬\ndents and the other having textbooks on\nreserve.\nNine respondents said their TV insti¬\ntutes were activity-oriented, the following\nbeing a sampling of their TV activities:\ntwo hours daily in the TV lab, with more\ntime near the end of the institute; foren¬\nsic activities, dramatics, music programs\npresented by institute participants; and\nstudents going through various positions\n(camera, floor, audio) on several small\nproductions and then, as the final project,\nbeing responsible for a half-hour show\nwhich they write, produce, direct, star in,\nparticipate as crew, etc.\nAll schools used a closed-circuit facili¬\nty for production work, and three could\nuse a videotape recorder for institute pro¬\nductions.\nHalf of the respondents said there was\nsome kind of industry participation in the\nTV institute. The most common such ac¬\ntivity was taking students on tours of the\nlocal radio and TV stations, and during\nthe tours the students usually received\nlectures from station personnel. Local TV\nstations awarded scholarships to two in¬\nstitutes to assist in financing student ex¬\npenses.\nAll respondents had at least one facul¬\nty member involved in teaching and di¬\nrecting institute activities; four institutes\nused graduate students in addition to fac¬\nulty ; and one used undergraduates as lab\nassistants.\nAll TV institutes planned extracurricu¬\nlar activities for students, such as ban¬\nquets, theater parties, dances, talent shows,\ntours, concerts, lectures, movies, and “a\ntrip to Glacier National Park.”\nNew Membership Category\nFor State ETV Associations\nThe NAEB Board of Directors has just\napproved the following resolution: That a\nnew category of Associates be established\nfor State Educational Television Authori¬\nties; that official State-wide Educational\nTelevision Authorities which either are\nmembers of the appropriate NAEB divi¬\nsion or who do not qualify for membership\nin any division may affiliate as State Edu¬\ncational Television Authority Associates.\nAnnual dues will be $35.\nETC Facilities\nProgram Actions\nAt the end of June, these actions were an¬\nnounced by the ETV Facilities Program:\n• Applications for financial assistance in\nconstruction of ETV stations were accept¬\ned for filing for Ch. 66, St. John, Ind., and\nCh. 9, North Platte, Neb. Total estimated\nproject costs were, respectively, $204,086\nand $439,762.\n• An application was accepted for ex¬\npansion of operations of WCET, Ch. 48,\nCincinnati. Total estimated cost: $91,898.\n• Grants in the following amounts were\napproved for new ETV stations: at Oma¬\nha, Neb., $100,000; Ch. 57, Terre Haute,\nInd., $185,958.\n• Grants in the following amounts were\napproved for expansion of operations: Ch.\n62, Tacoma, Wash., $110,434; Ch. 10, Pull¬\nman, Wash., $88,253; Ch. 6, Sacramento,\nCalif., $77,547; Ch. 6 (San Juan) and Ch.\n3 (Mayaguez), Puerto Rico, $300,193; and\nCh. 9, San Francisco, $189,433.\nNAEB Files\nPetition with FCC\nOn July 15, the NAEB, through its at¬\ntorneys filed a petition with the FCC re¬\nquesting it to review and reconsider its\nFourth Report and Order (Docket No.\n14229) regarding UHF allocations. NAEB\ncontends that the Report and Order offends\nprocedural due process and sound alloca¬\ntions policy, and that it “is gravely prejudi¬\ncial to the interests of educational broad¬\ncasters.”\nThe NAEB has also requested a time ex¬\ntension of 60 days beyond the July 20\ndate for comments, and August 5 for reply\ncomments.\nFord Foundation Grant to\nCommunity ETV Stations\nThe 32 community-owned ETV stations\nin this country will be the recipients of a\n$10 million grant from the Ford Founda¬\ntion. Matching funds ranging from $50,000\nto a maximum of $500,000 per station will\nbe made, beginning in the fall. New com¬\nmunity stations going on the air for the\nduration of the four-year program will be\neligible for the grants.\nUSOE Names Deadline\nfor Institute Proposals\nThe USOE has invited colleges and uni¬\nversities to file proposals to hold institutes\nfor educational media specialists for summer\n1966 and the academic year 1966-67.
