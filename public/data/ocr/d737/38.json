Of all the tests we conducted, this was the only one to\nwhich objection was voyaged and the objection was almost\nunanimous.\nEveryone felt that this test was most unscientific\nto which I agree, yet at the same time, I feel that there are\ncertain benefits to be gained from such a test. I should be\nvery glad to have further reports on your work. 3orae time in\nthe future we may again undertake a program of testing. We\nlearned a great deal making the present tests and 1 feel that\nwe can do a much better Job the next time.\nYours very truly.\nAJElEEF\nA. James Ebal\nChief Engineer"
