I think that we shall give most of\nthese tests to our equipment also just for our own satisfaction.\nOur antenna is in operation now. It is a 400* Truscon tower,\nshunt excited* At present we have a 2000* line from the trans¬\nmitter to the tower. It is a T|M, buried in fiber conduit and\nhas given us practically no trouble. We had an open circuit\nat first due to a poor solder job but we lost no time on the\nair because of it.\n»5 v, ?.c\\\nThe cmtracts have been for a new R.C.A. Transmitter and\nfor about $3000 worth of audio equipment, also R.C.A. This will\ngo into a building which is under construction now. We hope to\nbe in the new building by about the middle of Seotember. The new\nlocation will shorten our transmission line about 300* .\nOur first measurements indicated that we did not have as good\noutput from the shunt excited tower as we might exoect. We have\nimproved the coupling system since then, but we have not made any\nmeasurements on the new arrangements. We do not plan to do much\nmeasuring until we get the new equipment installed.\nYours truly,\nTO\nW. E. Stewart\nChief Engineer - WOI\nWES:mo"
