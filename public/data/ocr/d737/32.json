Fouoh\nUniversal Microphone Co.\nCentenella on Warren Lane\nInglewood, California\nDear Mr. Fouoh:\nWe have Just oompleted tests on the\nUnicord recording machine. We had no difficulty\nwhatsoever in operating the machine since there\nwas practically nothing to do but set the head\ndown and let it run. A slight adjustment for\nthe depth of out was the only adjustment we\nmade.\nThe frequency response test showed\na peak at 200 cycles and another peak at 4000\ncycles* and not a great deal of level recorded\nabove 5000 althou$i traoes were present up to\n10,000 cycles. The other measurements on the\nmachine have not yet been completed bÂ£t will\nbe submitted to you along with the report on\nall other machines.\nThe tests were conducted exaotly as\nwere the tests on the other Universal machines\nwhich we had. Of oourse they had to be made\nat 78 RPM and reoording was then Outside-In.\nOtherwise there were no changes.\nWe would appreciate a letter from\nyou giving us any additional oomments you\nmight have over your previous letter commenting\non these tests. We would also appreciate\nshipping instructions.\nYours very truly.\nA# James Ebel\nChairman\nNAEB Recording Committee\nAJE:EH"
