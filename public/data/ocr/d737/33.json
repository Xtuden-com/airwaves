Hopkins\nRGA iManufacturlng Co.\n689 East Illinois St.\nChicago, Illinois\nDear Mr. Hopkins:\nWe have Just completed tests on the\nRCA recording machine which you sent us.\nAlthough complete data has not been tabulated\nfrom the measurements! a rough inspection of\nthe light patterns indicates a response up to\n10,000 cycles with a slight peak at 5000 oyoles.\nThe recording head showed very nice dynamic\ncharacteristics also. The noise level was\napproximately 30 DB below standard recording\nlevel.\nThe tests were conducted as per the\nspecifications except insofar as follows:\nUnder the Method of Making Tests—\nla. During™the\" tests some machines were\nencountered which would record only\nat 78 RPM on a maximum diso sia© of\n12 inches. On these machines outs\nwere made at a diameter of 8 inches\nat a speed of 78 RPM.\nlb. This section was delted and standard\nrecording level was taken as that\nle#al recommended by the manufacturer.\nIt was pointed out to the committee\nthat the machines In service would\nin all probability be operated at this\nlevel and therefore our noise level\ntests would be more valid if made under\nthese conditions. In addition, there\nis no general agreement as to what\nshould constitute standard recording\nlevel."
