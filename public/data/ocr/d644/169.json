Lamb\nPage 2\nJune 16, 1961\nIn our judgement, a serious ommission in the new legislation is\nthe failure to provide credit in the matching requirement for preÂ¬\nvious expenditures for educational television facilities. As you\nsay, this is the kind of thing that rewards the laggards who have\nnever done anything up tiU now in ETV and penalizes those who have\nalready made a considerable effort and investment. We have hopes\nthat this provision can be restored in conference along with an\nincrease in the total amount of monies appropriated.\nSincerely yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH :rkf"
