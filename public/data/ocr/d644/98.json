Mr. Joe M. Kilgore,\nof McAllen, Texas, is a member of the House Interstate and Foreign\nCommerce Committee. While we don't have any NAEB members in that area,\nI thought you might have a friend there who, if he has not already done so,\nmight like to convey his views regarding this legislation to Congressman\nKilgore. Or, failing that, perhaps you, yourself, would like to do so.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEHijph"
