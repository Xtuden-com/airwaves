This is channel 15,\npresently in use as WFPK in Louisville ^Jefferson County. As an early\nstep toward establishing a statewide ETY network, the FCC should be\npetitioned to reserve channels for educational use among those allotted to\nthe state foT commercial use but presently unused. Good channels are avail¬\nable in most places in Kentucky where transmitters are to be located. Reser\nvation should not be especially difficult. Few or none of the channels to be\nrequested are likely to be taken up for commercial use in the near future:.\nMost are located in towns too small to support such relatively expensive\nundertakings.\n- 6 -"
