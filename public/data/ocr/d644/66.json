The MSB spectrum\nsurvey has no direct relationship to the basic development proposed by the\nMagnuson Bill (S3D5), the Roberts Mil (H.R. 132} and the others. Our\nsurvey is designed to determine: X. What re-armsgement of channel alloca¬\ntions can be effected to provide the ndnimum basic service for education;\n2. The number of additional channels over and above the basic service which\nwill ;be necessary to serve the needs of education in the 10-15 years insaed-\niately ahead; 3. tot plan of allocations can be devised to equitably\nprovide such channels.\nOur survey is looking to the next decade and beyond. Meanwhile\nthere is imperative need to put on the air channels for which allocations\nhave already been made. Today, as you know, there are 21% channels assigned"
