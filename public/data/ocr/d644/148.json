These\ncame from Alabama, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,'Maryland, Massachu¬\nsetts, Michigan, Minnesota,’Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey,\nNew Mexico, North Carolina, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\nRhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nEight replies were indefinite. In these cases,-the question was\npending before State legislatures, or the opinion of another official was\nbeing sought, or the Governor was not yet ready to deal with the question.\nThese replies were from Alaska, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Nevada, New Hamp¬\nshire, Ohio, and the District of Columbia,\nFourteen States have not yet been heard from. From other records,\nhowever, we know that six of these have one or more operating educational\ntelevision stations within their borders. They are Colorado, Florida,\nIt seems reasonable to anticipate that\nlater replies from these areas will maintain the high ratio of affirmative\nresponses evidenced by those already in hand.\nA Good Foundation Has Been Laid\nMany here remember the dramatic hearings before the Federal\nCommunications Commission in 1952 which resulted in the reservation of a\nblock of television channels for educational television.\n?
