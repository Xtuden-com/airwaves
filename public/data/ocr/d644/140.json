Rice\nGovernor1s Office\nSpringfield, Illinois\nDear Bill*\nFor possible assistance to the Governor, and for\nhis information, I*m enclosing a suggested draft of a letter\nhe might use in replying to the Inquiry from Congressman Oren\nHarris, a copy of Wisconsin’s Governor to a similar Inquiry,\nand an NAEB special report which has some background on the\npending legislation.\nBill, the Governor might also wish to consider the\npossibilities of appointing a Statewide Educational Television\nCommission. I’m sure there would be little difficulty in\nsecuring Legislative approval. One such resolution was intro¬\nduced last session, but it was ill advised because it didn’t\nget into channels. I know that Mr. Wilkins has a Committee on\nTeaching Aids, but this is not pin-pointed on BTV. Just a\nsuggestion. If any help needed at anytime, you know 1*11 be\nhappy to aid.\nAnd, to you, sir, many thanks for your trouble.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nDirector, University\nBroadcasting"
