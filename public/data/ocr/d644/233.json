In this respect we commend to your attention H132.\nIn terms of its crucial importance in helping education cope with the crisis\nin teacher and facilities deficits; in terms of the importance of serving\nallocations reserved for education before they are lost forever; and in terras\nof developing a social, educational and general public program since for\nthe entire nation * H132 would seem to merit early consideration.\nThe state-by-state studies which NAEB and JCEB have supplied your com¬\nmittee testify to the amount of interest and to the effort the states have\nmade in organizing their limited resources and planning for further devel¬\nopment. Much of this development has been sparked by the hope and pro¬\nmises of Federal legislation, which has now been before Congress three\ntimes. Mother postponement at this time would seriously handicap this\ndevelopment for years, - in some cases, many years. ETV has reached a\ncritical moment; it moves now or endangers its total progress •\nWe hope that your committee may see fit to report this measure out shortly\nso that it may be brought before the Rules Committee and then, hopefully,\nbefore the House of Representatives.\nSincerely ^burs.\nWGH/mm\nWilliam G. Harley"
