In\ndiscussing this with other members of the staff, we felt that there is\ncertainly a place for an article based on the premise that stations\nshould have the guts to stand up for certain things—essentially, to\neditorialize. lou have the beginning for such a piece in your article.\nHowever, we feel that your field is not wide enough! you are using only\none example. Surely there are others. (Without some supporting evid¬\nence, fear instance, I do not think we can blithely make the statement\nthat WMCA Is the on£sr static* in the country which editorially sup¬\nported Kennedy.) ^ r\nyou will study some of the other stations throughout the country (in¬\ncluding educational stations! WHA, in Madison. Wisconsin, has a long\n.history of airing the views of \"controversial\" figures, for example) and\nrewrite your manuscript to make it more of a plea for the idea you have\nin mind and less of a eulogy for WMCA, 1 would certainly like to see it\nagain*\nI hope to run your satire soon—perhaps in the November-Dee ember issue.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nbmok/sp\nblcc: Mr. Harold E. Hill\nMr* Walter B. Emery\nL(^JXt"
