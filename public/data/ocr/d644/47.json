  "text": "-14-\nKansas - this state has a state plan to provide much-needed ETV\nfacilities to 85% of its population. The legislature can see its way clear\nto provide only 1/6 of the development money needed in the hope that Federal\nassistance will add enough to make an encouraging start. Delay now will\njeopardize two years* work* and may cause the loss of several of the proposed\nchannels to commercial interests • One such channel is already slipping away\nfrom the State schools.\nKentucky - this state is currently developing a plan for an ETV\nnetwork. However, a favorable frequency, basic to the state plan, is already\nslipping away, and a group of frequencies upon which this network plan\ndepends will be in jeopardy if applications for the channels are long delayed.\nNebraska - this state has a plan similar to the Kansas plan, but it\nis entirely dependent upon taking immediate advantage of specific unassigned\nVHF channels. The state's claim is now being contested, and lack cf funds\nor delay in development will undoubtedly cause the loss of these channels.\nHere, as in Kansas, the loss of one or two channels would wreck the whole\nState Plan.\nNew Mexico — this state has built one ETV station and has plans\ndeveloped to furnish service to all the schools in the state, but it cannot\nbuild the other two stations without assistance, and again delay endangers\nthe necessary channels.\nMaine - this state has a plan, but has been unable to build\nstations to meet its needs. It is having difficulties defending its proposed\nuse of good channels. Delay at this time weakens Maine's chances of\neffective ETV development."
