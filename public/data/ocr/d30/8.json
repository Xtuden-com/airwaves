C.\nDear Mr. Stewart;\nThe matter of support for radio drama by the Corp¬\noration for Public Broadcasting has been discussed\na number of times in my deliberations with a variety\nof persons involved and concerned with educational\nradio programming.\nMy belief is that radio drama should be considered\nfor early support but that this type programming does\nnot merit first priority. However, were the Corp¬\noration to fund initially as many as five projects,\nradio drama should be included. The thought I want\nto convey is that other program categories (news,\npublic affairs, social action, etc.) need immediate\nattention. Drama is a radio staple and the Corporation\nshould support it when other needs are met.\nI*ve had an opportunity to addition excerpts from the\nRadio Pgatna Development Project underway at WGBH. I\nwould hope that if EPB decides to support radio drama,\nit lend assistance to the project now underway. This\nis consistent with the position I*ve taken regarding\ncurrent National Educational Radio Network activities.\nSincerely,\nRAM: lkl\nccs Ward Chamberlin\nRobert A. Mott"
