Rather\nthan send you a 1968 directory, you'll receive\nproof for the 1969 directory. It will be up-\nto-date including a perusal of the FCC files on\neducational radio stations.\nI know you are in a hurry but we'll have the\nproof In a day or two and will send it airmail.\nHope you agree the brief delay will be offset\nby the merits of an up-to-the-minute mailing\nlist.\nDelighted to learn you will attend the October\n22-24 meeting. Look forward to seeing you there.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAMslkl"
