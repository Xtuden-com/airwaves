Carlisle\nConsultant\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n545 Madison Avenue\nNew York, New York 10022\nDear Bob:\nIt was good to meet with you and Bob Swezey last\nweek. I trust the information made available to\nyou is of value. Let me know if there is more I\ncan do.\nWe are currently developing estimates on the cost\nof the proposed move of the National Educational\nRadio Network facilities from Urbana, Illinois to\nWashington, D. C. When available, I will advise\nyou.\nA copy of the proposal submitted by NAEB/NER to\nthe Arapex Corporation is enclosed. Currently, this\ndocument is being reviewed by personnel at Ampex.\nThe proposal is for your information. It is import¬\nant to note, I think, that both broadcast and non¬\nbroadcast utilization is envisioned for the National\nAudio Center — should it come into being.\nFinally, a list of educational radio stations with\nproduction facilities and competent staff is attached.\nThe list is not all Inclusive. There undoubtedly are\nothers with equal competence with which I am not\nfamiliar.\nI have contacted Hartford Gunn for the audition tape\non the drama series and will react to it as soon as\npracticable.\nSincerely,\nRAMslkl\nEnclosures\ncc s Robert Swezey\nRobert A. Mott"
