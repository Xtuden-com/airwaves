According to Broadcasting\nmagazine (which we think is possibly even more reÂ¬\nliable than the PCC re stations on the air and in\nconstruction) there were 341 educational FM*s licensed\nand 13 stations with construction permits on the air.\nIn addition, there were 30 stations with construction\npermits. Total authorization was 384 plus 20 AM\nstations that are non-commercial.\nThe budgetary categories and number of stations in\neach for NAEB membership for radio stations is:\nunder $10,000\n68\n$10,000 to $24,999\n33\n$25,000 to $99,999\n31\n$100,000 to $249,999\n14\n$250,000 to $499,999\n1\n$500,000 and over\n1\nThese are annual budget figures.\nIn addition, I am enclosing a copy of a digest of\nTHE HIDDEN MEDIUM. Pages 1-6 and 1-7 have some budget\ninformation that was gathered late 1966 and early\n1967. I believe it will be of value.\nWhile we have no objection to releasing the data for\nyour use in your work with CPB, I would hope that it\nwould not be published or disseminated beyond the CPB\nboard membership without our prior approval.\nLet me know if ye can provide any further data."
