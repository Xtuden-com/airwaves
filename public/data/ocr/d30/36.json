Enclosed are several pages Xeroxed\nfrom Television Factbook, which will supply you with some very general\ninformation i 7\"this area. This is not our book, therefore, I could not\nmail it directly to you. You should be able to obtain a copy in any\nlibrary. I suggest this because it also contains comprehensive listings\nof Television Households by States and Counties in addition to a multi¬\ntude of other information that might concern you. Hope this will be\nuseful ... if not too late.\nIn much haste, warmest regards, and \"hello” to Vin"
