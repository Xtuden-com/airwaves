It will be\nthe function of the bureau to provide to radio stations\nin depth coverage of significant news developments in\nWashington, D. C. both governmental and non-governmental.\nThe program material will be distributed via tape with\nduplication on the facilities of National Educational\nRadio in Urbana, Illinois. The bureau will be housed\nat WAMU-FM, the educational radio station at The American\nUniversity, Washington, D. C*\nConclusion\nThe capability of educational radio stations to transÂ¬\nmit news of transcendent importance as it occurs is a\nworthwhile goal.
