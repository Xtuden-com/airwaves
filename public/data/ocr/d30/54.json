A project, undertaken by a professional opinion research\nfirm, aimed at developing a low-cost audience measurement technique\nfor public radio. Such a pilot project, using students and the - -\ndepartmental research and programming facilities available at most\nuniversities, might make available to far more stations than at present,\nthe chances of determining audience needs and responses. If some\ntechnique could be outlined in some detail, a technique using readily\navailable facilities for the'1 sample development and polling work, it\nwould make available to even relatively low-budgeted stations the kind\nof information about its audience which could make for much improved\nprogramming effectiveness.\nII. A pilot project, in which the Foundation would explore the\nestablishing and funding of community ten watt stations. These\nstations, now relatively easy to put on the air, could provide a new\nand powerful dimension to local programming. If licensed to re¬\nsponsible agencies in low—income neighborhoods, to non—English\nand ethnic communities, these stations might provide vital services\nto the neighborhood or community. Useful local information and\nservice programming could be instituted. Job training in areas\nrelated to broadcasting could be undertaken, at a level likely\nto produce more direct* results than that undertaken in many programs\nat formal educational licensees. And, when many college stations see\nas one of their functions helping to provide an institutional bond\nfor diverse student bodies, such stations could provide useful centers"
