Mott, Director\nNational Educational Radio\n134-6 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington, D.C., 20036\nDear Bob:\nYour idea of sending proof for the 1969 NAEB cflFectory\nof educational broadcasting is an excellent one from\nmy point of view. The timing of the directory is\nquite fortuitous.\nNER could be of very material added assistance. I\nbelieve that a letter from you telling your members\nof the importance to CPB of the information sought in\nthe questionnaire and of their responding promptly\nwould be effective in both increasing the number of\nresponses and in getting them back in time for quick\ntabulation before the CPB Board meeting on November\n20 th.\nI hope you will circularize your members promptly.\nThe questionnaires will be ready by Wednesday. The\nletter of transmittal is ready also, waiting only\nfor a count of the number required before duplication.\nAs soon as these are run, I will see that you have\ncopies of each.\nCordially yours.\nam ; m\ncc:' Saul Haas\nP.S. I am wondering whether some of the stations in¬\ncluded in the directory are non-commercial in opera¬\ntion. Specifically, I raise questions regarding\nWRUF-FM, Gainesville, Fla., WHCU and WHCU-FM, Ithaca,\nN.Y., and WHAZ in Troy, N.Y."
