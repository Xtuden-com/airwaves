Hobbs, Chalmers H. Marquis, Lewis Rhodes,\nH. Holt Riddleberger, Jerrold Sandler\nFROM: Mr, C. Scott Fletcher, Executive Consultant\nAs promised I am sending you the biography of Mr, Frank\nPace, Jr* as it appears in Who's Who in America,\nAfter reading this you will be able to appreciate more\nreadily what a distinguished career he has had in both private\nand public service in this country and abroad. Some of the\nmembers of the ETS Board of Directors received this biography\nin New York on April 21 when he made a formal appearance to\nall those present at ETS Day, Consequently and also because of\nthe nature of the small dinner party at the Congressional\nCountry Club, it was decided that on this occasion his intro¬\nduction should be both informal and anecdotal in character.\nWe are indeed fortunate to have Mr. Pace as chairman of\nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He hopes to receive\nfrom all radio and television stations the same type of cooper¬\nation he is determined to extend to all of them. I am sure he\nwill not be disappointed. You will be seeing and hearing a great\ndeal from him and his prestigious fellow directors in the years\nto come.\nBest wishes."
