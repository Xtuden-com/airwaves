D. Neuwirth\nof Metro Radio Sales, explains, \"Our goal is not to show\nhow to use sound effects but, rather how sound affects\npeople. W© feel that advertisers should know how\nsound affects people. We want to show what people\nhear and what they react to. We want to show what\nmotivates them to buy, and we feel that the men spending\nmoney in our medium want to know these answers too.\"\nRadio is a medium of imagination. If the creative\ntalent exists to bring imagery of an audience into\naction, financial support should be provided for exper¬\nimentation.\nRaymond Swing suggested, \"If the eye gets Into the act,\nthe mind's contribution is diluted.\"\nThe opportunity for aural experimentation in educational\nbroadcasting should be encouraged."
