Commercial\nradio is seen to provide the majority of public radio needs, and\na new program format would fill in the gaps and continue to serve\nspecial audiences as at present.\nIt is in accordance with this view that any new service should\nprovide news \"in depth\" to complement (or first-aid) commercial\nnews headlines; should continue to concern itself with specialised\nsubjects, and limited local audiences; should eschew pop music\nbecause there is so much, encourage folkmusic because it is\nhealthy, and supplement classical music because not enough people\nlike it.\nPatch-work radio sees itself essentially as supplemental and\nsupportive of commercial radio, providing the public with whatever\nthe advertising media cannot sell. Its chief advantages would\nbe (a) the improvement of existing program sources."
