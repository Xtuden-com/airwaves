Philosophical Attitude\nThe budget section of Radio Projects (page 8), unlike\nthe section on TV Projects, opens with a preamble that\nis essentially negative. Statements such as, \"Many\nareas are not served at all by such (radio) stations.\nElsewhere, the signals are inadequate, and the stations*\ncapabilities fall below a socially useful level.”\nRecommendation: No action now. Gentle persuasion\nlater.\nTV/E Special Projects (page 6) $500,000\nRecommendation: NAEB supports this portion of the\nproposed budget but would urge that this item be placed\nin R/TV portion of the budget and that the projects\nInclude a *pilot* national interconnection to allow\nthe simultaneous broadcasting of appropriate program\nfare over all educational radio stations.\nTV/G National Interconnection (page 7) $25,000\nRecommendation: NAEB urges the Corporation to include\nradio in any study of nationwide interconnection. TV/G\nbe redesignated as a joint proposal for both R/TV and\nthe study include both media.\nR/TV E Effective Promotion of Public Broadcasting\nRecommendation: That the pilot project be conducted\nin a market in which a single licensee operates both an\neducational radio and TV station.\nMy final comment does not relate to a specific portion\nof the budget. I note a marked difference in the type\ntelevision programs proposed and the suggested radio\nproductions. The latter include drama, music, leterature\nand talk. None is exactly \"fire in the belly” type\nprogramming. The TV projects are gutty in nature. They\ninvolve the TV stations in the issues of the day and\nhold forth the utilization of ETV as a medium for solving\nsocial problems.\nRecommendation: That educational radio be given an op¬\nportunity to program in the area of social issues. None\nof the proposed projects should be deleted. Added pro¬\ngram proposals are included."
