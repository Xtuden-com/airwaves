Thanks for sending them along; I'll\nsave them incase any need arises. The assistant has no experience\nin broadcasting, but has qualifications which make me feel that he\ncan learn whatever is needed for the study while he is using his\nother experience to the advantage of the study. I'll probably\nbring him to Washington with me and let you teach us both what\nto do. When we get down there, perhaps we can all go to lunch\nor dinner and the two of us can pick your brains a bit.\nThank you again for your help. I hope that I may call\non you whenever something comes up that demands your advice,\nassistance, or assurance. It has so far been reassuring; and that\nis not be denigrated these days.\nSincerely,\nSamuel C. 0 Holt"
