Chamberlin\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n545 Madison Avenue\nNew York, Ndw York\nDear Wards\nIt was good to meet you and talk with you last week.\nAs you asked, I provided Bob Swezey with copies of\nthe three radio proposals. If you seek amplification\nsifter you have reviewed the documents, please let\nme know. Supplementary comments may prove helpful.\nWe discussed the possibility of appropriate individ¬\nuals from the Corporation staff participating In\ninformation sessions during the NAEB Convention in\nWashington in late November.\nWe all understand that the timetable is nebulous\nbut I would hope that someone from the Corporation\nwould be able to talk to a group of about 150-200\neducational radio station managers. A session has\nbeen scheduled at 2:00 p.ra. Friday, November 22 for\nthis purpose.\nSince the session follows Frank Pace's luncheon\naddress to the NAEB Convention, it would be desirable\nto relate his general remarks to some specific Infor¬\nmation for the radio station managers.\nThe usual format is suggested. Prepared comments\nranging from 30-40 minutes with time allowed for\nquestions from the floor.\nJust as the Corporation is learning about educational\nradio, station managers need to develop an under¬\nstanding of the Corporation role. There is no better\nopportunity to reach a large group of managers than\nthat provided by the NAEB/NER Convention.\nI hope we can firm up on this.\nSincerely,\nRAM: l)cl\nRobert A. Mott"
