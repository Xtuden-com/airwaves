Pastore, D-\n, R.I., as ‘'one of the most important bills\n1 to be considered in Congress this year.”\nPastore’s description is no rhetorical exag-\nI geration; it is accurate.\nour view, the measure—aimed at the re-\n| vitslization and expansion of public television\n\\ ana radio—could have as significant impact on\nI adult education as the Land Grant Act of 1862.\nI' The administration-backed bill thus far has\n■a approved by the Senate with commenda-\nI ble dispatch and enthusiasm, and has been\n| sea} to |be House of Representatives for study\ns action. In addition to providing matching\ntunds to states for more educational broad-\n| casting facilities, ihe measure would establish\nJa nonprofit corporation to oversee a vastly-\nI enlarged educational TV and radio system.\n|, *!1 ^e fi~st year, this corporation would\n.■3 nave only a $9 million budget. However, we\n|see th|s initial public investment as “seed\nJ t0 §et the project under way. Ulti-\nI n-iv-Z s,everal hundred million dollars—from\nle u\" WeH as public .sources—will he\nneeded annually to finance a first-rate educa¬\ntional TV and radio network.\nWhiie organized opposition to the broadcast¬\ning measure has not developed, there are in¬\ndications that the bill may encounter difficul¬\nties in the House.\nCO.vIL congressmen have openly expressed\n. concern ^ that federally-supported ETV\nmight provide the government with a propa- i\nganda outlet. It seems to us that the bill pro-\nvides adequate protection on this score by\nstipulating that the governing corporation be\ncompletely independent.\nAnother charge being put forth is that an f\nPYrtnnHprf TnTV _ .\n* “*• • ■ xiuj;m cunipeie un¬\nfairly with commercial TV. On this point, the '\nmeasure clearly favors the development of\nhigh-quality ^ noncommercial TV and radio :\nbroadcasts that complement, rather than com- f\npete with, commercial programs.\nWe hope the House will give the broadcast '\nbill the same solid support that the Senate\nhas provided it."
