  "text": "mutual authority, including representatives of the stations and\nprogram suppliers, and operating on a daily basis with these daily\nproblems independent of the Corporation, except for its continuing\nsupport and surveillance, affords the best opportunity for satisfying\nthese needs in a practical and free manner.\n\"4. The Corporation is the supplier of funds. As such, it carries\nthe ultimate responsibility for all of its activities, including the\nessential interconnection service as Dr. Killian indicates. That\nresponsibility should be exercised in its review of the conduct of\nthose entrusted with providing the service, and in its decisions to\ncontinue to support one such entity over another. But that review\nshould not properly encompass day-to-day program decision-making\nfunctions by the Corporation of the interconnection entity.\n\"5. We share Dr. Killian's fear of the establishment of such a\nstrong educational network that programs would be determined by\nremote fiat with an attendant loss of diversity and local autonomy.\nHowever, the NAEB submits that the fears generated by historical\nreference to commercial networks are greatly allayed by the absence\nin noncommercial operations of the commercial motivations surrounding\nsuch network systems.\n\"6. The NAEB thoroughly supports Dr. Killian's view that the\nCorporation should be precluded from program production, and from the\nprerogative of program scheduling.\"\n7/18/67"
