Staggers\nChairman, Interstate and Foreign\nCommerce Committee\nU. S. House of Representatives\nWashington, D. C.\nDear Congressman Staggers:\nWe should like to respond for the record to several points\nwhich have arisen in connection with testimony on HR 6736.\n1. $250,000 LIMIT PER STATION - TITLE II, SECT. 396 (k)\nSince the language of the bill appears to include the cost of\ninterconnection, this would mean that a program grant to a\nstation or to a regional or national network might well be eaten\nup in interconnection cost, whereas the funds ought to go\nprimarily for program production.\nWe suggest adding the words \"excepting costs of interconnection.\"\nThe line would then read: \"Notwithstanding the preceding\nprovisions of this section, no grant or contract pursuant to\nthis section excepting costs of interconnection may provide\nfor payment from the appropriation for the period year\nending June 30, 1968, for any one project or to any one station\nof more than $250,000.\n2. THE 12%% LIMIT ON FACILITIES GRANTS TO STATES - TITLE I, SECT. 102\nDoes this limitation mean smaller stations will not receive funds\nor that some states may be left out?\nNo. Experience with the 1962 ETV Facilities legislation has shown\nthat grants have gone to all sizes of stations and in virtually\nevery state. We are confident that HEW would continue to\ndischarge its responsibility with due concern for the interests of\nall the states, taking into account grants already made to states\nand reserving funds for those states which are not yet ready to\nconstruct. Since the plans of several states could not go further"
