Someone has apparently squelched his enthusiasm\nfor radio which we should perhaps revive.\nOne of my reasons for calling last week was to tell you that I’m not\ntrying to pull a ’’Doddism”, When I left the Kenwood Club I intended to\npay my bill by check since, as I told you, my expenses were being covered\nhere. But the clerk made me feel so bourgeois not just charging it I said,\nwhy not? As soon as my reimbursement comes I’ll send you a check.\nThe Floyd Christian testimony is coming slowly. I hope to have some¬\nthing to read to you after this weekend.\nPeace!\nSincerely,\nK__ „__lan\nMN/je"
