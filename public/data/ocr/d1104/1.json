  "text": "TV Technical Tips No. 19\nby\nCecil S. Bidlack, NAEB TV Engineer\nThis column is being written in New York far from our usual base of\noperations and near the end of a 17-day trip. We know we*re perilously near\nthe deadline for copy for the April Newsletter and hope this reaches Head¬\nquarters in time to be included. Before leaving Urbana we had a number of\nthings noted to include in this column. We hope our memory is good for the\nlist we need is safely filed in our desk back home.\n*****\nFirst we want to mention that before we left Urbana, technical details\nand a schematic of the WOI-TV Gray Scale Generator were mimeographed and\nmailed to all our educational TV stations and those closed-circuit studios\nwe had listed with kinescope recorders. We feel sure that our list is not\ncomplete so we’d be more than happy to fill a request from anyone we missed\nwho wants this information. We believe 'a gray scale generator is almost a\nmust for kinescope operators, and if you don’t have $1,750.00 to buy one,\nthis one of Keith Ketcham’s may be very useful to you.\nTalked to Fred Remley of the University of Michigan at the IRE Conven¬\ntion and he shares the above opinion. He also added that they improved the\nstability of operation of their WIGKES Linearity Checker (gray scale genera¬\ntor) by regulating the AC power input to this equipment.\n*****"
