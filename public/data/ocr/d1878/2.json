Their new line of fm transmitters, designed\nespecially for the 88-108 me educational band, con¬\nsists of 10, 75, 250 and 500 watt transmitters. The\nlatter two transmitters have been type accepted by\nthe FCC and the 10 and 75 watt models are now\nbeing processed for approval.\nWith the number of fm stations on the air grow¬\ning daily, and with no more fm channels available in\nlarge population centers, educational institutions\nwould do well to take another look at fm broadcas¬\nting. Pressure is certain to develop for the FCC to\nassign the unused channels for commercial use, once\nthe available commercial assignments are occupied.\nFor years Gates Radio Company of Quincy, Illinois\nhas been the sole manufacturer of fm broadcast\nequipment. The RCA announcement of a new fm\nline and now the I.T.A. announcement points up the\nfact that fm is again on the upswing. The announce¬\nments also emphasize the need for educational in¬\nterests to get busy and occupy these reserved chan¬\nnels while they are so easily available.\nTV TECHNICAL TIPS (February)\n— Cecil S. Bidlack\nOn Jan. 15, I had the privilege of attending a dem¬\nonstration of the new RCA color video tape re¬\ncorder in Camden, N. J. More than 100 broadcasters\nand engineers attended the afternoon demonstration\nincluding Fred Remley and Larry Griewski of the\nUniversity of Michigan, Dr. W. J. Kessler of the Uni¬\nversity of Florida, Cy Braum of JCET and the writer.\nWe saw Art Hungerford in the group attending the\nmorning demonstration and there may have been\nother ETV representatives we missed seeing.\nWe were very much impressed by the performance\nof the equipment. Some observers thought the quality\nof the recordings as good as live pick up. Sections of\nthe Perry Como Show of the previous Saturday, and\na portion of the same day’s Howard Miller Show\nwere presented in color as well as a specimen of\nblack and white recording. Tape dropouts were in\nevidence on both the monochrome and color record¬\nings and were especially noticeable in the color re¬\ncordings since they produced white noise flashes.\nThe RCA system is similar to Ampex in that tape\nwidth, tape speed and the tape itself are the same.\nRCA uses a revolving head mechanism holding four\nheads, although head rotational speed differs slightly\nfrom the 1440 rpm used by Ampex. At present tapes\nare not interchangeable between machines, however\nthis feature will be available on production models.\nRCA and Ampex are discussing mutual standards so\nthat eventually universal interchangeability will be\npossible. RCA equipment is entirely rack mounted\nwhile Ampex uses a console-mounted transport mech¬\nanism with part of the equipment rack mounted. The\nRCA equipment also incorporates an erase head while\nAmpex tapes must be bulk erased. RCA has an addi¬\ntional independent audio cue channel so that special\noperative instructions can be recorded along with\npicture information.\nA price of $63,000 has been announced for the\nRCA color recorder and $49,500 for monochrome\nequipment. Production models are expected to be\navailable toward the end of 1958 with seven proto¬\ntype models to be built and put in service prior to the\nproduction run. Monochrome equipment contained\nin five racks, can be converted to color by the addi¬\ntion of one rack of color processing equipment. The\nequipment requires 6 kw of 60 cycle single-phase\npower for operation.\n*****\nAmpex, too, is making an accessory kit to con¬\nvert its monochrome video tape recorder to color. It\nconsists of an additional rack of equipment costing\n$29,000 for the prototype units. The first of these\nhas been promised for June delivery to WGN-TV,\nChicago. A substantial reduction in price is expected\nonce this equipment is on a production basis.\n*****\nDamage estimated at $75,000 was caused by a fire\nJan. 9 in Swain Hall, which housed the studios of\nWUNC-TV and WUNC-FM in Chapel Hill, N. C. It\nis believed that the fire was the work of an arsonist\nas seven fires occurred on the campus that day. Spun\nglass used in the sound treatment of the studio area\nprevented the fire from spreading, thus saving the\nbuilding from complete destruction.\nThe radio area suffered only smoke and water\ndamage. It is expected that the radio studio will be\nready for occupancy before Feb. 1. Much video\nequipment was saved. TV programming was moved\ntemporarily to the Raleigh studios. However, on\nJan. 20 some programming was resumed from Chapel\nHill by using the remote bus as a studio. It is ex¬\npected that it will take at least six weeks before the\ndamaged studios and offices are ready for occupancy.\n*****\nGeneral Electric has announced that 50 TV sta¬\ntions are now equipped with “1-0 guards” the wobbu-\nlating device designed to improve the useful service\nobtained from image orthicon camera tubes. Among\nthe ETV stations which are using this equipment are\nMARCH 1958"
