These\nmen are*\nVernon Bronson\nW, Do Donaldson\nJack McBride\nCarl Menzer\nCiair Tettemer\nRichard Vogl\nTheir consents follow.. It should be noted that each of them was in sub¬\nstantial agreement with the others. I abridge comments only in order to\nreduce the size of this meao.\n2o a, Bronsons \"This memo represents far more than the NAB3 should\never give. We already have network programming interests represented\non our Board, Why should we ask for representation on the Affiliates\nGoismittee? We should be represented on the WET Board, Moreover,\nstation activation should be the prime consideration of the HAJBB,\nNET should co&FIn® itself strictly to Programming.®9\nb. Donaldson; ®*X am disgusted with the measo from Karley to the\nHASB Board. ..,, The teras offered by the Center are wholly in3uffi~\ncient, those offered by NAEB are almost cowardly .. HAEB seems\nt© be taking a back seat with an agreeable view toward being pushed\noff. The Centers plan to assume authority over activation of new\nstations and networks is fearful .... What the NAEB Executive Com¬\nmittee ... let be proposed ... smacks of either a sell-out or a\ndamned bad job of negotiation.”\ne. McBride; \"The Center ought to be a programming organization.\nThese proposals, if activated, would mark the end of the NABB as we\nhave known it.®*"
