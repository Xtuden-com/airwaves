The present obvious attempts of the NETRC to dominate\ntotally the national FYV picture are repugnant to me person¬\nally and,more important, are not, in my view, in the interests\nof education as a whole or educational television in particular..\nYou will have to find someone who needs money a little worse\nthan X do just now.\n(3) The fact that William Harley is, as you stated,\nassociated with the NETRC in this matter does not change or/\nopinion of the moral values thereof. Indeed, X deplore Harley0s\nassociation with the NHTRC in this, as in many another matter.\nPerhaps Mr., Harley0s error in this, as in other respects, can\nbe brought forcefully to his attention in the near future.\nWith kindest personal regards,\nJCSsbh\nccs NAEB Board\nMr. William Harley"
