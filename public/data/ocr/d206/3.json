Harley\nPresident, NAEB\nI3I4.6 Connecticut Avenue\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nThanks for your memo to Board of Directors of April 3 and the\nattached material.\nRegarding the Draft of Proposal for NAEB-NETRC Working Relation¬\nship, I believe I expressed my opinion in Milwaukee that NAEB should\nnot give up, as one of its primary responsibilities, the \"development\nof additional educational radio stations, methods of interconnection\nthere of, and new patterns of program distribution.\" To me this\nindicates, at least in some measure, consideration of shifting our\ntape network and any plans we may have for a live network, to NETRC.\nIn Paragraph VI,\"International' Educational Broadcasting\" refer-\nance is also made to primary responsibility for foreign program\nmaterial; its planning, production, distribution, and transmission\nthereof being the primary responsibility of NETRC. We were told\nthat NAEB had contacts in foreign lands and could develop them in\nan effort to augment local tape network, programming. I would like\nto see NAEB continue with this as one of its primary responsibilities.\nI also question the desirability of having one organization respon¬\nsible for exchange of consultants, over-seas visits and other inter¬\nnational affairs and another for the international programming. It\nseems to me that by exchanging consultants and overseas visits a\ngreat deal of international programming can be developed.\nI am sure these things will be discussed at our Columbus meeting\nand am looking forward to learning more about them.\nSincerely\nCarl H. Menzer\nDirector, WSUI-KSUI\nCHM/pt"
