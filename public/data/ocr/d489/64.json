C.\nDear Bill:\nIt has been two months since we met in Washington at the\nNAEB Convention. We, of course, were delighted that the\nProgramming and Employment Committee resolutions were passed\nby the Board and the various divisions.\nThe Committee on Programming Practices, which was asked to\ncontinue its work, still has no direction as to what the\nAssociation would like us to do for the upcoming year. I\nwonder if you would make your thoughts known about this subÂ¬\nject to us.\nBest wishes for 1969.\nSincerely,\nRJM/mka\ncc: Committee on Programming\nRichard J. Meyer\nChairman\nCommittee on Programming Practices\nPractices"
