We have not sought data for those\nrejecting less than ten per cent of the scheduled service on\nthe assumption that occasional deletions for technical or content\nreasons are not necessarily indicative of any important trend\nor policy(unless it be that acceptance is easier than rejection).\nDuring October-December, 1968, fourteen stations reported broad¬\ncasting less than ninety per cent of the NET programs listed in\nthe scheduled service. The chart below lists these stations,\ntogether with the number of programs rejected and the reasons\nfor rejecting them.\nStation % No. of programs Reasons for Rejection\nBroadcast rejected_\nWGSF\n77\n14\nNot broadcast by feeding\nstation(WOSU) - 4\nLive local program commitments -\nChristmas vacation - 1\n\"Early sign-off\" - 8\nKETS\n84\n12\n/V\nObjectionable content - 10\nDated content - 2\nWQLN\n84\n12\nTechnical problems - 12\nKPEC\n85\n11\nChristmas vacation - 5\n\"Pre-empted\" - 3\nPoor tape quality - 1\nProgramming error - 1\nInterconnection failure - 1\nKUID\n86\n10\nChristmas vacation - 10\nWSJK\n88\n9\nThanksgiving & Christmas\nvacations - 4\nPre-empted for local program - 1\nProgram delayed in mail - 1\n\"A.T & T. lines unavailable\" - 1\nNo reason given - 2\nA listing of programs rejected because of objectionable con¬\ntent is given in the following section.
