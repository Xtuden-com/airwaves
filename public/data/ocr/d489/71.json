Harley\nPresident\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n.1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bill:\nAfter receiving a copy of your memorandum to Richie Meyer\nwith regard to our Committee's resolution submitted to the\nExecutive Committee of NAEB, I talked with him because I was\nupset with your memorandum.\nMy first thought was to remain silent until Richie had\ncommunicated further with you but I have thought it over\nand since the time is short, I felt I must write to you. When\nI was asked to be on this Committee I was given to understand\nthat NAEB was concerned about this problem. I don't feel\nthat the emasculation of our resolution signifies real concern.\nThe members of our Committee were unanimous in the resolution\nthat we prepared and putting aside the nit picking changes\nthat the Executive Committee made, I am particularly distressed\nwith deletions which make NAEB's position less than forthright\nin several instances and most importantly by deleting para¬\ngraph six continue to make us collectively a ’’toothless tiger.”\nThe members of the Committee worked with great sincerity\nto produce this resolution. I would object to it being\nsubmitted to the Convention as revised by the Executive Committee.\nI believe that there are many broadcasters who in all sincerity\nfeel about the need for changes in our approach especially\nto the black community most strongly.\nIf the Executive Committee insists on presenting the\nresolution as revised, I as a member of the Committee would like\nit made clear that this is the Executive Committee's version\nChicago Educational Television Association"
