C. 20036\nOctober 15# 1968\nMEMORANDUM\nTo : Dr. Richard Meyer, Chairman\nProgram Practices Committee\nFrom: William G. Harley, President\nNAEB\nSubject: Executive Staff Consideration of Program Practices\nCommittee Report\nThe Executive Staff met this morning to consider the resolution on\nprogram practices initiated by your committee. You and your com¬\nmittee are to be congratulated for the excellent work in drafting\na strong, progressive philosophy which reflects a positive attitude\nof our Association.\nThe Executive Staff unanimously supports the resolution and will\nrecommend its passage to the NAEB Board and its affirmation to the\nConvention.\nA few word changes have been made which I would like you and your\nCommittee to consider; in my judgment they in no way dilute the\nresolution.\nParagraph #1 - \"It is clear that\" is superfluous. The\nstatement now begins \"All noncommercial\nbroadcasters....\"\nThe opening sentence now continues, “....must\ncontinue to be concerned ....\" \"continue to\"\nsuggests an ongoing movement, rather than the\nstart of something entirely new.\nParagraph #2 - \"proceed immediately to\" is deleted because\nit adds nothing significant and because it\ndoes suggest an overly-authoritarian posture\nfor the NAEB.\nThe final sentence is deleted; the assumption\nis that the program reports indicate clearly\nthat a dialogue has already begun.\nOFFICE\nOF THE PRESIDENT"
