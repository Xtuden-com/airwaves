KLVX rejected\nthe Nina Simone program because of several \"unacceptable\" songs.\nWUCM, University Center, Mighigan, rejected the same program\nbecause a \" certain segment would be offensive to our viewing\naudience.\" KETS, Conway, Arkansas, rejected the same program.\nWKNO, Memphis, deleted the program from its schedule because\nof a \"profane song.\"\nAn NET Special, \"The American Image,\" was not carried by WENH,\nDurham, New Hampshire, because it was considered merely \"another\ndistinguished panel of experts\" program. Another NET Special,\n\"The Nixon Cabinet,\" was not carried by WSIU, Carbondale, Illinois,\nbecause another program had been scheduled, and it would have\nduplicated what commercial stations were carrying simultaneously.\nThe Black Journal was not carried, by several stations, although each\nprogram was treated as a separate matter by those stations which\nrejected any of the series. Black Journal No. 10, for example,\nwhich featured Julian Bond, was not carried, by WGTV, Athens, Georgia.\nAlthough the station reports that Julian Bond had appeared on the\nstation at another time, it felt this particular program would\nhave \"fanned the fire,\" since it commented about Governor Lester\nMaddox at a time when he was commenting negatively on the Ford\nFoundation and public broadcasting. KETS, Conway, Arkansas, by\ndecision of its governing Commission, decided not to carry any\nof the Black Journal programs.
