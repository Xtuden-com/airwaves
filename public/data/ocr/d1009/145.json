This figure plus the 13.4 per cent primary advertising time gives\na total of 18.3 per cent as the amount of program time devoted to advertising.\nIn 1953, secondary advertising was nearly twice as great as in 1954, but\nthis difference is almost certainly due to the fact that different procedures were\nused in computing secondary time. The following diagram shows how the amount of\nsecondary advertising time was computed in previous years:\n/ a / b /c /_d _/\n7 ® /\na « time in the station break\nb as time given to primary advertisements\nc = time devoted to public agency announcements\nd = time in program content\ne = program time accompanied by secondary advertisement\n(8)"
