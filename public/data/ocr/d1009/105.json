But his asso¬\nciation with the industry dates back many\nmore years than that. He started out as a\nsportscaster, doing special broadcasts for\nthe Los Angeles Times from 1926 through\n1929 while he was working his way\nthrough the University of Southern Cali¬\nfornia. During this period he also worked\nas a sports writer for the same paper, was\na copy writer in the Los Angeles offices\nBARR °f two San Francisco advertising agencies.\nHe cast his lot definitely with radio in\nSeptember, 1937, when he joined NBC in Hollywood in the\npublicity department. Later became director of publicity for\nKFI-KECA (latter station now KABC). When ABC pur¬\nchased KECA, in August, 1944, Barr went along with the new\nowner as a salesman. Was made station and regional sales\nmanager in November, 1951. Born in Liverpool, England, was\nbrought to the United States when still a child, and became\na citizen at the earliest opportunity. A member of the Los\nAngeles and the Hollywood Advertising Club, also a member\nof Sigma Delta Chi, the national journalism fraternity, to\nwhich he was pledged while attending U. S. C.\n★ ★ ★\n• • • “Wuthering Heights” will be the initial program\non “Lux Radio Theater,” when it returns, Tuesday, September\n14, NBC. Program will be a tribute to Samuel Goldwyn with\nproducer to make a personal appearance.\nPurdue Panel Notes\nIncreased Violence\n(Continued from Page 1)\nwith entertainment continuing to\naccount for more than three-fourths\nof all program time, while drama\nconstitutes the largest single class\nof entertainment. Comedy drama is\nseen to be on the increase while\ncrime drama and domestic drama\nappear to be decreasing. General\ninformation programs suffered a\nrelative decrease in 1954, while\nnews programs of all kinds seem to\nbe at a stable level. Religious pro¬\ngramming evidenced a slight gain.\nIt was also found that increases in\nprogram time from network sta¬\ntions, coupled with decreases in\ntotal time from independent sta¬\ntions, caused the proportion of live\nprogramming, as compared with\nrecorded material, to increase in\n1954.\nDuring the week studied, there\nwere 7,065 acts and threats of vio¬\nlence monitored on the seven chan¬\nnels of New York commercial tele¬\nvision, the study shows, represent¬\ning more than twice the total of\n3,421 acts and threats observed in\n1953, and two anld one-third times\nas much as counted in 1952. It was\nfound that 97 per cent of all vio¬\nlence monitored in 1954 was in en¬\ntertainment type programs, with\ndrama programs containing the bulk\nof violence, with Westerns showing\nthe second highest frequency. The\nstudy also evidences that the fre¬\nquency of violence on TV is higher\nduring the children’s hours (5-7\np.m.) than in other time periods\nor in all time periods together, both\nfor all types of programs and for\nentertainment in particular. It was\nfound that children’s comedy drama\ncontains the bulk of both quantity\nand frequency of violence in the\nchildren’s hours, far exceeding the\namount and rate observed in other\ndrama categories.\nPointing out the vital role of TV\nas a determinant of public opinion\nthe study emphasizes the many\nprobiems affecting the telecasting\nof public issues, such as objectivity\not the program, selection of the ex¬\nperts and the danger of a pehsonal-\nization of issues. Though by no\nmeans an indictment of television\nthe study cites the potential dan¬\ngers and points out how little has\nbeen done in evaluating the extent\nto which these problems have been\nmet or dangers circumvented. The\n1954 monitoring indicated that many\npublic issues programs presented\nbut one view of the topic under dis¬\ncussion and that few are free from\nproselytizing for one or another\nview, and stated that it was im¬\npossible to judge, however, whether\nor not TV programs are prone to\navoid controversial issues.\nMade possible by a grant from the\nFund for Adult Education, the study\n™ greeted by H. H. Remmers\nwith Robert E. Mainer.\nCombs For Davis\nEffective Sunday, July 4, news\nanalyst George Hamilton Combs will\nbegin a weekly summer series of\nSunday evening news commentaries\nsubstituting for Elmer Davis, over\nthe ABC Radio Network from 10-15\nI to 10:30 p.m., EDT."
