I shall be\nglad to provide this a little later when I am less pressed with other matters\nthat at the moment, on the assumption that you would like this for your\npossible future guidance on similar projects. It is my understanding that\nwe did this on a contract fee basis. You would not have paid more if we\nhad overshot the cost estimate, nor less if we had undershot.it.\nMy delay in responding to your letter of June 22 was occasioned by\nmy having to read proof on a book revision now completed thanks to much\nlabor and whatever gods there be'.\nThe check for #1,450 that you said Frank Schooley was sending hasn’t\nyet arrived.\nCordially yours,\nH, H, Remraers\nDirector\nHHR:jk\nEnclosures"
