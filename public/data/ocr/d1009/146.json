  "text": "In 1953, the amount of secondary advertising time was found by summing the\namount of \"d\" for all programs where \"e\" was more than 50 per cent of \"d\", In\nother words, the amount of secondary time reported in previous years included much\nmore than the actual amount of secondary advertising time in programs with more\nthan 50 per cent secondary advertising, and included none of the secondary advertÂ¬\nising time found in programs with less than 50 per cent secondary advertising.\nSince the necessity for this roundabout procedure for computing secondary\nadvertising was not clear to the present investigators, only the actual amount of\nsecondary time (i.e., the ne\" portion in the above diagram) in all programs was\nused in this year's report.\n(9)"
