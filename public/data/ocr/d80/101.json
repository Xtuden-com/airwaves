In addition,\nalthough we do not attempt to persuade our meiBbers to patronize\nour Sustaining and Industrial Associates in preference to other\nconcerns, it is only reasonable to presume that educational\nbroadcasters, often struggling on minimum budgets, would prefer\nto give their business to those commercial concerns which have\nevinced a sincere interest in the welfare and furtherance of\neducational broadcasting.\nWe hope that you will consider affiliating with us in the\neducational broadcasting movement. If you have further questions,\nplease do not hesitate to get in touch with me.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nH/mlm"
