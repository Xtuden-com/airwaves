  "text": "Mr. Duncan Whiteside (Con't) -2- September 2, 1964\nAct which provides $32 million for the construction of ETV\nfacilities. We prepared detailed information for the congressional\ncommittees which held hearings on the matter, we provided testi¬\nmony and we brought into Washington, at our expense, several \"lay\"\nleaders from around the country to explain what ETV would mean\nto their communities.\nWe have been very much involved in the matter of the new copy¬\nright law, and with other educational interests are working\nwith the Copyright Office to try to insure that the proposed\nnew copyright legislation will not have the dreadful adverse\neffect on educational uses of material (not just broadcast) that\nit first appeared might be the case.\nWe are currently conducting a study on microwaving to try to\ndetermine education’s eedds in this area. There has never been\nmuch thought given to this, and yet these channels, too, are\nbecoming scarce. In addition there seems to be evidence that the\npresent bankwidth does not provide enough resolution and defini¬\ntion to adequately convey the detail necessary in certain educa¬\ntional transmissions, such as in the field of medicine and other\nsciences. We are hoping to determine just what the real needs\nare/\nWe are currently engaged in a $100,000 project to prepare six\ncolor half-hour films on utilization which are designed to help\nInform teachers and administrators how they can make the best\nuse of television in instruction. These films will be available\nto NAEB members sometime next fall to show to the people they\nwant to \"educate.\"\nI trust this will give you some idea of the kinds of services\nrendered by the NAEB. If I can provide any other information,\nplease do not hesitate to let me know. The tentative convention\nprogram and reservation cards which you requested are enclosed.\nWe look forward to welcoming you into the NAEB.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill"
