Bill Harley indi¬\ncated I would send you information about membership for\nMivai-Dade Junior College.\nMs you know, we have four institutional categories of membership;\nthose with television stations may belong to ETS; those with\nradio stations belong to NEK; those producing programs (either\nfor use on their own CCTV systems or for broadcast on another\noutlet) for direct instruction may belong to our instructional\ndivision; and those producing programs or utilizing CCTV for\ngeneral adult audiences may belong as institutional Affiliates.\nI am enclosing some mimeographed information about these various\nmembership categories and the dues structure which is common\nto them all. Since I don’t know how far you’ve progressed\nwith your plans, I can’t tell what catagory you should be in.\nBut these materials should help you make some decision. Please\nlet me know if you have any questions after reading the attached.\nWe cdrtainly hope you folks will get on the NAEB bandwagon as\nsoon as possible.\nYes, Sandy is now in stewardess training school in Kansas City.\nShe graduates on April 1, and has enjoyed every minute of it.\nGive my regards to Frank.\nCordially,\nHarold E.
