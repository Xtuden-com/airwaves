But until this office gets into\nmore complete operation our activities will be limited to\nproviding programs only for our own station and other local\nstations.\nI am also including in this letter my request for an NAEB\npublication. Sorry I didnH get around to taking advantage of this\nearlier.\nIncidently let me put in my vote for the revised format of the\nJourna 1. I would, however, like to see \"About the authors....‚Äù\npreceding each article rather than lumped in the first pages.\nSincerely,\nIrwin P. Starr\nDirector of Broadcast\nServices\nAdvisor to WECI"
