Wheeler\nMarch 15, 1966\n- 2 -\nImportant, becoming \"part of the family\" at our regional and\nnational meetings, thus permitting more informal and intimate conÂ¬\nversations with our members. In addition, although we do not\nattempt to persuade our members to patronize our Sustaining and\nIndustrial Associates in perference to other concerns, it is only\nreasonable to presume that educational broadcasters, often struggling\non minimum budgets, would prefer to give their business to those\ncommercial concerns which have evinced a sincere interest in the\nwelfare and furtherance of educational broadcasting.\nWe hope that you will consider affiliation with the NAEB in its\ncontinuing 46forts to expand and improve educational broadcasting\nthroughout this country. If you have further questions, please do\nnot hesitate to get in touch with us.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nVice President"
