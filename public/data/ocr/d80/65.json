C. 20036\nDear Bill:\nI hope that you will be able to attend the Region II meeting in\nWilliamsburg, and if so, will look forward to chatting with you at that\ntime*\nI thought, while it was fresh in my mind, that I would drop you\na line and send you a copy of a letter I received from the education\ncoordinator at one of our schools. It is self-explanatory as to the\nrecommendations. You will probably recall that this problem was part\nof our discussion several months ago in your office. It is impossible\nto pay for organizational memberships for military installations under\nthe present set up of dues, etc. The suggestion that USCONARC join as\nan organization, and then assist its member schools, may or may not be\na valid suggestion. I would have to investigate this possibility. At\nany rate, I think is worthy to note the kind of interest we have in\nyour organization.\nHope to see you in Williamsburg.\nSincerely,\n1 Incl\nas\nTHOMAS J. DOLAN\nCivilian, GS-II4\nEducation Specialist"
