Selby\nAssistant Professor of Education\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\nSaskatoon, Canada\nDear Mr. Selby:\nFirst let me apologize for our not responding more quickly to\nyour letter of December 15. X believe each of three people\nautomatically assumed that someone else was going to handle\nit and, therefore, none did.\nAt the present timef the entire matter of membership in the\nNAEB by organizations and institutions from other countries\nis under study by a membership committee of our Board of\nDirectors. Prior to our reorganization in 1963 we had permitted\nCanadian institutions to belong to the NAEB in certain categories\nof membership, but the reorganization made Canadian memberships\nsomewhat more complicated. We certainly want to encourage as\nmany Canddian institutions as possible to Join our Association\nand are attempting to work out the best possible plan. If you\nwill bear with us a while longer, I will inform you of the\nBoard's decision as soon as possible.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/mlm\ncc? Mrs, Dorothy Templeton"
