NEW JERSEY 07703\nSIGD1-1\n1 March 1965\nMrs. Dorothy Templeton\nMember Relations\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbaha, Illinois 61803\nDear Mrs. Templeton,\nApproximately one year ago I wrote to Mr. Harold E. Hill\nstating that the US Army Signal Center and School would be unable\nto continue its membership in the NAEB because of the change in\nmembership categories and the cost of such a membership to the\nschool. Mr. Hill's reply dated January 20, 1964, indicated that they\nwere aware of the problem confronting military schools who used\nclosed circuit TV and who desired to continue some affiliation with the\nNAEB. He also indicated that some arrangement might be worked\nout to include military members in a special category, but that our\nmemberehip would be continued in in unofficial manner and we would\nbe kept on your mailing list. Has anything further developed along\nthie line?\nWhile you requested the name of our TV coordinator, I would\nrather that you address future correspondence to Mr. Murray Teeser,\nDeputy Chief, TV Division, Office of Academic Operations, US Army\nSignal Center and School, Fort Monmouth, N. J. 07703.\nWe will encourage individual membership in the NAEB if this Is\npossible. Perhaps in your reply to Mr. Tester you could send such\ninformation as well at information pertinent to the question Tasked\nabove.\nSincerely,\nUS Army Signal Center Ik School\nNEIL G. SMITH\nEducation Coordiriator"
