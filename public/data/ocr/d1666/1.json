  "text": "President Griffith assured Mr* Dunham that we should be glad to\nconsider all three ideas very carefully and fully when we had a larger\nand more fully representative meeting of the NAEB. That we were grate-\nh.il for the suggestions, and would formally take then under condiden-\nation*\nThe time for the next annual meeting was then informally considered*\nSeptember 9 and 10 seemed most generally favored, but it was decided\nto submit the selection of the exact date to a letter ballot*\nThe question was raised as to whether we should meet as the guest of\none of our member stations or at some centrally located city, as we\nhave been doing recently. A majority of those present seemed to favcr\nmeeting with a college or university that is aregtilar member of our\nassociation. Invitations were then extended to meet in September\nwith Iowa State College, State University of Iowa, University of\nIllinois, University of Kentucky, and the University of Wisconsin;\nbut it was decided to submit the final choice to the letter ballot\nthat will fix the exact date.\nNext the type of program for the annual meeting in September was\nbriefly considered. The president asked whether we wished a general\nprogram , dealing with ourown immediate problems, as was done last\nyear or whether at least one speaker of national reputation should\nbe seeured. It was decided to add this question to the circular\nballot, and thus get an expression of a larger po^rtion of the member'-\nship. But it was suggested that if a speaker of sufficient reputatiai\nshould be secured for the meeting, it would be desirable to have his\naddress broadcast over one of the regular radio chains.\nSubmitted by\nB.B.Brackett\nSea-T^eas., 1\nNASB.\nÂ»"
