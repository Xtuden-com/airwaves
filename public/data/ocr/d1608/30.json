  "text": "Director Powell writes—\nThere is not a commercial\nstation in the State of Florida\nthat covers the territory that\nWRUF covers while on the\nair. Nor is there a station in\nthe State that either finan¬\ncially or otherwise can give\nthe educational features and\nthe vast amount of informa¬\ntion concerning State Univer¬\nsity or Federal Government\nactivities.\n1. It disseminates infor¬\nmation about Florida.\n2. It presents farm and\nother agricultural informa¬\ntion to farmers and growers,\nas well as market reports,\nsheriff and police reports,\nUnited States weather information, etc.\n3. It supplies road information to tourists, or\nto those who contemplate trips to Florida.\n4. It brings information and emergency reports\nfrom the Federal Government to the people.\n5. It brings the people of Florida educational\nfeatures from the University, information of\nworld events, broadcasts of athletic games and\nmeets, messages of prominent national and inter¬\nnational figures and entertainment not covered\nby other radio stations in the State.\n6. WRUF is a laboratory\nfor students desiring techni¬\ncal or program experience in\nradio art. During the worst\ndays of the depression, when\nthousands of experienced\nradio people were jobless,\nWRUF students who had fin¬\nished their University course\nand who had gained their ra¬\ndio experience at WRUF\nwere more successful in ob¬\ntaining positions than any\nother similarly trained\ngroups.\nWRUF has built up an ed¬\nucational program that has\ngiven it a place among the\nleading educational stations\nof the Nation. We have been\ninformed by authorities who\nare in position to know that we maintain a stand¬\nard above that required by the Federal Govern¬\nment. We have received recognition by national\norganizations cooperating with State agencies. In\nour Engineering Department we are preparing to\ncarry on research and experimental work in con¬\njunction with the United States Government. The\nFederal Government feels that where it is helping\na State in research work, to protect the people of\nthat State from calamities such as bad storms and\ndamage to crops by frosts, the State should assume\na proportionate share of the expense.\nMajor Garland Powell, director of WRUF\nWSAJ\nGROVE CITY COLLEGE\nGROVE CITY, PENNSYLVANIA\nFrequency:\n1,310 kilocycles.\nPower:\n100 watts.\nFounded :\n1922\nOn the Air:\nThree hours each week.\nPrograms :\nAthletic events, musical recitals, college de¬\nbates and college plays.\nTalent:\nLargely from the student body.\nStation WSAJ has just completed the modernization of its trans¬\nmitter.
