  "text": "-5-\nb. NAEB dues (as distinguished from service charges etc. which may be established\nby Divisions) are assessed across the board for all members as a basic fee for the\ngeneral support of the Association and its services (publications, placement service.\nHeadquarters staff, etc.) and must, therefore, be a determination of the overall Board\nof the Association.\nc. If the proposed new dues structure based upon operating budgets (actual\nexpenditures plus equivalents) is adopted, there need be no concern for the “dues\nof the TV stations being raised disproportionately, as a means of using TV stations\nto provide greater support for NAEB services to the other Division.’* The new\nformula, once adopted,applies across all Divisions and any adjustment in the formula\napplies to all members equally.\nProposed General Association Dues\nOperating Budget\nLess than 25,000\n25,000 - 99,999\n100,000 - 249,999\n250,000 - 499,999\n500,000 and over\nAnnual Dues\n$100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nIt should be kept in mind that the ideas proposed in the Appy memo and/or the\nmodifications recommended by the Executive Committee must not be regarded as\nestablished. The NAEB Board will determine what changes or additions are to be\nmade in the amendments (as distributed) to be presented to the convention for\nconsideration and vote. It should be remembered also that this is an effort to put\ntogether a radically different structure; hence, it is understandable that there will\nbe some bugs in any blueprint we draw. However, if we can adopt the plan for the\ngeneral structure now, alterations can always be made in the light of experience\nat subsequent annual conventions.\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident"
