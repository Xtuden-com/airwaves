  "text": "For the PUBLIC SERVICE\nOne of the FCC requirements which radio licensees must meet is that program time be devoted to public service.\nOther radio stations, because of commercial commitments, can only schedule a minimum of time to fulfilling this\nrequirement. WNYC, because it is municipally-owned and operated, could, and did, schedule all of its time “ ... in\nthe public interest.” Part of this service to the public consisted of the distribution of non-commercial spot announce¬\nment packets.
