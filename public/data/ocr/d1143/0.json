The NCSCT was estab¬\nlished (in August under, a USOE grant) to\nacquire and distribute highly effective TV\nmaterials for use in classrooms throughout\nthe country, and to serve as a central in¬\nformation source about the use of TV in\neducation.\nU. of Georgia Studies\nLearning Potential\nA new research and development center\nat the University of Georgia will study\nlearning limits and attempt to establish new\nnorms for learning; develop and field test\nnew curriculum materials (textbooks, vis¬\nual aids, etc.) ; and distribute findings and\nmaterials to elementary and secondary school\nteachers and administrators—aiming to im¬\nprove education practices.\nThe U. S. Office of Education is pro¬\nviding about 3.2 million dollars under a five-\nyear contract; the university will spend 1.8\nmillion during the same period.\nNAEB History Printed\nNAEB History, Volume I, is now ready\nfor distribution from the NAEB publica¬\ntions office, 119 Gregory Hall, Urbana; the\nprice is $2 each.

Harley\nas EMC president for the coming year,\nsucceeding James D. Finn. The NAEB is\none of 14 member associations of the EMC\nAppalachia Group Plans\nCommunications System\nNAEB’s Appalachia Broadcast Commit¬\ntee has presented a plan for a regional\ncommunications system to the Appalachian\nRegional Commission. In a report prepared\nfor the committee by the Kentucky ETV\nAuthority and the Kentucky Area Devel¬\nopment Office, the group sets forth its\nplan for a network of interconnected edu¬\ncational radio and TV stations, and calls\nfor speed in putting the system into opera¬\ntion.\nThe report suggests a working council\nof representatives from each of the 11\nstates involved, the council to apply for\nfunds to support a three-pronged study:\n(1) of the technical feasibility and require¬\nments of such a system, (2) of the program\nservices the system should attempt to pro¬\nvide, and (3) to determine ways and means\nto involve and stimulate the people of the\nregion and motivate them to utilize pro¬\ngram offerings.\nNAEB Filing\nHelps Indiana ETV\nThe FCC recently denied a Kentucky\ncommercial broadcaster’s petition to delete\nChannel *9 as a reserved channel at Evans¬\nville, Indiana, and reassign it for commer¬\ncial use. The NAEB and others had op¬\nposed the petition.\nThis channel is the one which the South¬\nwestern Indiana ETV Council plans to ac¬\ntivate. In its filing, the NAEB pointed out\nthat there is not a single ETV station in\noperation in Indiana and that a station on\nChannel *9, the only VHF reserved chan¬\nnel in the state, might be in the forefront\nof ETV activation and development in the\nstate.\nOTHER RECENT NAEB FILINGS\n1. The NAEB filed reply comments in\nthe matter of regulation of CATV, urging\nthe FCC to adopt measures to avoid cur¬\ntailing local initiative and interest, local\ncontributions, and local ETV service.\n2. The NAEB opposed a petition to\npermit one-way paging on unassigned TV\nchannels.\n3. The NAEB supported the allocation\nof Channel 8 to Medford, Oregon, and its\nreservation for educational use.\nNAEB's 41st Convention\nAs we go to press, the NAEB annual\nconvention is still in the future, October 31-\nNovember 3, in Washington, D.C. Though\nthe convention will be over by the time\nreaders receive the Newsletter, because of\nthe timing we cannot report on happenings\nat the convention in this issue.\nBut we can make a few comparisons with\nprevious conventions:\n1. As we go to press, there are already\nover 1,000 advance registrants for the 1965\nconvention. This is twice the number who\nactually attended the previous convention in\nWashington, in 1961.\n2. NAEB now has almost 2,000 Individ¬\nual Members. It was at the 1962 conven¬\ntion, in Philadelphia, that membership\nreached the 1,000 mark.\n3. From the Journal of the AER\n(predecessor of the NAEB Journal) of\nOctober 1952, we learn that then Senator\nHubert H. Humphrey keynoted the annual\nconvention for that year, in Minneapolis.\nVice President Humphrey was slated to\n1"
