The figure for cities of over\n25,000 is correct, although considerably out of line with the other\ngroups. A choice of ten other cities of over 25,000 would perhaps give\na quite different answer. Could the farmers, least satisfied with the\namount of local news available, be thinking of farm and market news?\nWhat do the other groups understand by the word local, or towhat extent\nare their repl ies colored by their liking for sports, or their interest\n,'n special types of news? Does the greater satisfaction of big city\n'\"listeners mean that they get more and better local news or that they\nare less interested in it?"
