  "text": "-4-\nOn opening day of the winter Olympics at Cortina D'Ampez-\nzon, Italy, nearly three hours of telecasts were carried by\nEurovision to Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Holland,\nFrance, Belgium and Great Britain with commentary in six\nlanguages.\nSir Tom O'Brien past president of the Trades Union Con¬\ngress, advocated in the March issue of TV Newsletter the\nformation of an Anglo-American Television Council. Sir O'Brien\nsaid, \"We do not want an American-dominated television market\nin Britain, and there can be no British-dominated market in\nAmerica. In both communities and in the Commonwealth there\nhas to be some kind of reciprocal agreement.\" He further\nfelt that such a council could stop mutual accusations and\n\"brick-bats\" which are being hurled. \"There must be recip¬\nrocal trade agreements,\" continues Sir O'Brien, \"and now is the\ntime for them to be negotiated. It is useless to let the posi¬\ntion deteriorate, and then ask the Governments to step in when\nthe industry itself should have acted in the first place.\"\nEighteen months ago the first experiment in the use of TV\nin Canadian classrooms was presented by the National Advisory\nCouncil on School Broadcasting and the Canadian Broadcasting\nCorporation. Such'interest was aroused among teachers and\neducation officials that the Council recommended a further\nexperiment on a larger scale. All the arrangements are now\ncomplete and this second TV-for-schools trial started April 17\nwith the presentation on the CBC-TV network of the first of\n15 specially prepared telecasts of 10, 20, or 30 minutes in\nlength..- This second series'involves a wider range of grades\nand subjects than the first, but its aim is the same—to help\ndetermine the role TV can play as a supplement to regular\nclassroom lessons. Many teachers have helped to develop the\nexperiment and all taking part by using the telecasts in their\nclasses are urged to help with the evaluation."
