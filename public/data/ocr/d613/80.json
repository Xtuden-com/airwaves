I am not sure that your Committee\nreached any sort of agreement on this matter when we met in Chicago, but\nif you have any definite ideas or suggestions, please let me know# Harry,\nFrank and I will be glad to consider any suggestions you might have for\nimproving the method of handling a news release.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEH:cr\nEnclosure"
