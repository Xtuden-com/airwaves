I got a letter from\nHarold Hill in connection with this whole matter in which he asked that I\nprepare a digest of the publicity and promotion fact sheet for the general\nNewsletter which is right along the lines of what you were asked to do\noriginally.\nI am sending a copy of your letter to Jim Miles and Harold Hill, and if\nJim would approve, I would be glad to give up the idea of the specialized\nfact sheet and shoot on to you any items that I get in response to my\nletter.\nI are certainly glad that you brought this to my attention. Still hope you\ncan get down to Bloomington so we can have a \"folk festival” on© of these\ndays. As an added inducement, I should say that my son-in-law living down\nin Tuilahoma, Tennessee, sends me up about every few months a gallon jug\nof 150 proof Tennessee redeye — which should certainly augment our abili¬\nties to research this interesting phase of Americana.\nElmer G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nJames Miles"
