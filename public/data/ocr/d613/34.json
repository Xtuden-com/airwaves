However, Z am dropping Leonard Marks a note on this which\nI m enclosing. I apologise to both of you for the absence of spe¬\ncific* reference or more adequate identification of the proposed\nruling.\nWith regard to the press releases, I would guess that special re¬\nleases are needed eidy on the workshops, the new consultant teams\nproject, our scholarships project, the TV Fact Sheet service, and\nour grant-in-aid axmounoemiyts due soon, I imagine that reference\nto the Siebert piece, the new E ngineering Sfewsletter and other\nmatters would be desirable, bui wsdcl nffie too much, unless you\ncan think of a gimmick.\nI believe the new heading paper was sent to you yesterday. If you\nhaven't already returned the blank type, as I believe Harold requested>\nplease do so. The wrong paper was sent you by mistake.\nI don't have anything to report on either the Convention Planning\nCommittee mooting in Chicago, or the Executive Committee meeting\nof Sunday also in Chicago, sine© I was so covered up with other\nmatters that I was unable to attend either. Off today to Research\nCommittee meetings in East Lansing, followed by a meeting at the\nCenter in Ann Arbor.\nSincerely,\nHJStcr\nCCt Hill\nCohn it Marks\nHarry J* Skomia\nExecutive Director"
