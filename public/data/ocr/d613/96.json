  "text": "retention of this type of item, with most of the other members of the\ncommittee favoring deletion. Sulzer pointed out that he would like to\nsee the Newsletter become more like the MKTB Mbzaber Service publications.\nMiles pointed out that maybe there is a need for a quarterly (or\nsimilar) which would include the educational articles, clippings, \"gossip, #\netc., because if we eliminate those from the regular Newsletter and cut\nit down, there will be a resultant void. Sulzer pointed out that maybe\nwe ehouldn#t try to fill this void.\nThere was general agreement, though not unanimous, that the Newsletter\nstill needs shortening. The discussion then returned to the possibility\nof having two publications rather than one. It was pointed out that per-\nhaps there are two factions in the membership which need to be served,\nand therefore maybe two publications could do a better job. It was sug¬\ngested that the MSB might put out a professional journal (possibly bi¬\nmonthly or quarterly) with different printing and containing nothing but\nreal professional items. Then a monthly \"gossip1' sheet could also be\npublished, much in the present form, to fill the apparent need for that\ntype of information.\nIt was agreed that a study of some sort needed to be made to deter¬\nmine what the members really want. Miles reminded the ccssmittee that\namong the recommendations made to the Board was one asking that the\nResearch committee make such a study. Since the Board took no action,\nand therefore such a study is not likely to materialize in the near future,\nthe committee felt they should make some sort of study on their own. MELlea\ninstructed Sulser to develop a questionnaire to determine members9 atti¬\ntudes toward the Newsletter. Sulzer will circulate copies of the proposed\nquestionnaire to the committee who will make comments and pass on to Miles."
