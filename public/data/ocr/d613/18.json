Parry\nof 10 watt educational stations. This strikes me as being\njust the kind of information that a school thinking about\ngetting into this field would find valuable.\nI like the factual handling of the data which gives the new\nstation operator a chance to see what others are doing to\nsolve specific problems. Perhaps the tables may give a\nwrong impression as to the comparative value of certain\ntypes of equipment even though they do give popularity by\nuse. I mention the table on recorders in which only one\nstation uses an AMPEX which is certainly fine which several\nuse less expensive and therefore more esaily purchased types.\nIn other words the implication is not the £est but the most\nused.\nI believe that this study could well be duplicated for\ndistribution to 10 watt members and such others as might\nbe interested. Certainly it could be used as an information\npiece to answer some of the questions new stations might be\nasking.\nFor the Research Committee I will approve this for distribution\nto members and for such other uses as you may have.\nSincerely yours,\nR.J.Coleman\nChairman, NAEB Research Committee"
