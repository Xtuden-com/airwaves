  "text": "To Indiana School Administrators\nOur postwar era of reconstruction has\njust begun. We must work together to\nestablish a strong and permanent peace.\nWe must create a better world in which\nthe newest contributions of science, the\ntechniques required to operate them, and\nthe political wisdom to control them will\nbe developed for the benefit of all peo¬\nples. Our job is the proper preparation\nof young people for such a world. If we\nare to be in the vanguard of social prog¬\nress, we must use all the techniques of\nmodern science at our command.\nThe fact that over ten thousand stu¬\ndents from more than one hundred schools listened to the Purdue School\nof the Air last year indicates that many Indiana schools are aware of\nthe potentialities of radio education. Many more, anxious to partici¬\npate, await the availability of adequate equipment for schoolroom use.\nNearly all are convinced of the usefulness of this particular scientific\naid to learning.\nWe hope you will be among those who will find it possible and\npractical to listen to the Purdue School of the Air this year.\nFREDERICK L. HOVDE\nPresident, Purdue University\nFrederick L. Hovde\nTo the Teachers of Indiana\nThis bulletin serves to introduce the\nthird year of the Purdue University School\nof the Air. We believe you will profit ma¬\nterially by thoroughly studying the\ncourses offered and then using those that\nare applicable to your classroom work\nthis year.\nWBAA is proud to be able to again pre¬\nsent a School of the Air. As always, we\nwelcome your comments and suggestions.\nJIM MILES,\nManager, WBAA\n— 2 —"
