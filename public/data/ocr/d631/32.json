Hull, Pres*\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nWOI, Iowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Mr. Hull:\nThank you very much for your letter of June 13,\nand I am encouraged that you have forwarded the\nmaterial to Seymour Siegel.\nThe American public knows so little about the\nMiddle East, and the Middle East plays such an imÂ¬\nportant strategic role in all our efforts to create\nworld peace, that all efforts to provide authentic\nfirst-hand information to leadership groups within\nthe American public are well worth whatever efforts\nare required.\nThank you again for your cooperation.\nSincer\nDirector"
