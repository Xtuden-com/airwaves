  "text": "Mr* Jim Miles\nOctober 2, 1950\n-a.\nfte I do, the program evils of optioned time on the commercial networks*\nI doa°t want to negate any of your suggestions, hut l still query\nthe advisability of a large expenditure of money for the purpose of mafe=>\ning all programs immediately available to all stations (under your pro®\nposed plan) when such program® have no dated significance. Th© only\nvalue of such an operation would be in the publicity and promotion that\nit might make possible,. There is no appropriation whatsoever in your\nbudget for proper publicity released on a national scale* I would much\nprefer seeing the resources for immediate program availabilities, l*e0,\nindividual tapes to ©ach station, be utilised for program® of immediate\nnews significance, or for those programs which are of such lasting value\nthat the stations could make them a part of their libraries for re*use*\nIn this latter case, your budget figures for replacement of tap© must\nnecessarily be increased*\nItIJ s extremely difficult to analyse a proposal via the mails ando\nas 1 have indicated to you, it°s even more difficult when you know your\nown station will not b© able to participate* It is entirely possible\nthat you have th© answers to some of th© objections 1 have aa&©6 and I\nhop© you will have taken thaa into consideration by the time w© get\ntogether at Lexington*\nIn th© meantime,, we have just received another $600* grant from\nCooper Union ©o that the present operation will b© able to continue at\nleast until January, when either you or Illinois will be in a position\nto take it over*\nWith all best wishes, I am\nAs ever*\nSSS#cb\nSeymour H* Siegel\nDirector"
