SIEGEL\nDirector\nJOHN DE PROSPO\nExecutive Officer\nSeptember 1, 1950\nMr. Richard B. Hull\nTfSOI, Iowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Dick:\nI am tremendously grateful to you for picking up\nthe cudgels, as indicated in the copies of your letters to Allen\nand Waldo* I’m sure you’ll be able to calm the situation down*\nIt occurs to me that this is the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of NAEB, and it might not be a bad idea to arrange\nfor the promotion of an hour or two-hour show which would\ninclude greetings from the presidents of all member institutions\nand also Hennock, Senator Johnson, Coy,etc. Certainly, there\nought to be musical contributions from each of the stations. The\nwhole show should be taped, and sufficient copies made so that\nit could be presented on all stations of the network simultaneously.\nSener could probably jazz the production up with plenty of Hollywood\nnames, and the whole thing might well lend itself to national\npublicity.\nP.S. I don’t know why NBC, ABC, and Columbia, might not be prepared\nto put on a national salute to HAEB over their own networks.\nP.P.S. I leave the TV picture to you#\n\"The\nVoice Of Tfie City"
