  "text": "Mr. John Witherspoon, September Sth,\na deadline for reply we were able to proceed with the program\nschedule without having to wait for replies which straggled\nin. Even with this deadline, however, if replies are received\nafter the set deadline, we would, wherever possible, include\nthese stations on the schedule.\nThe Report Sheets (a copy of Srhich is enclosed) were devised\nas a means of keeping a check on the Network. This is the\nonly means we have here of knowing exactly what is going on.\nIt is seilfk the only means we have of getting up a critique\non the Network.\nWe are up against the same problem that you are. Namely,\nthe size of the Network. The original schedule included\nten stations. We now have over thirty. But we’re extremely\npleased at the results we’ve attained.\nThe main job is that of paper work. Each series has individual\nOfferings and Report Sheets. But the main concern in this job\nis constant hounding. A check is kept of all Report Sheets\nwhich are returned. About once each month I review the entire\nNetwork and check off those Reports which are outstanding.\nI have 3et up a special form (enclosed) which I send to the\nindividual stations listing these programs. Generally speaking,\nthis one reminder is enough to get the ball rolling, but there\nhave been instances where I’ve had to go through this procedure\nmore than once.\nI think this about covers the operation from this end. I hope\nI»ve been as specific as you desire, but if you have any further\nquestions, let me know and I’ll be happy to help you.\nSincerely yours,\n(Mrs) Terry Linder\nCo-ordinator"
