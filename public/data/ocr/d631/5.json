S:/ .\nThanks very much for your Aoril 18th letter. I do under¬\nstand your position completely and X see why it is suite impossible to\ninclude any labor stations in the picture. My thought was not very\npractical at the moment, I believe, and It sprang from the discussions\nthat Probat and I had in connection vdth the ford financed network\nwhereby we included there stations along with educational stations\nhoping that the outlets would, pay a nominal fee for the orrpose of\nusin/r the program* This has no relation to the present operation\nand I shouldn’t have brought it up.\nI completely sympathise and appreciate what you*re\ndoing. I think you*re making strides — the first significant strides\nanyone has made — in setting up an educational network, and I realise,\nthough not as acutely as you who are the victim, how much extra pain and\nworry this involves — particularly the matter of getting firm answers\nfrom the brethren, as you say.\nOne item of encouragement, I think, is the news George frobst\nmay have given you, which is rtill confidential, that the ford Foundation\nIs finally getting itself ret, that they have selected a director and that\nin the preliminary screening our project emerged and is one of the first\ntwo or three to be considered by the organisation.\nt!?ill go into this a little bit more at Columbus. Best wishes.\nCordially,\nEBKiTH\nHiehard B. Hull\nBadio-TY Director"
