This\ninformation was given your secretary by Mr, Novik after a talk\nwith Mr. Early.\nThe letter from RCA-Victor, which apparently went to all radio\nstations, would seem to complicate matters, therefore this morning\nI asked Mr. Novik by wire to get in touch with Mr. Early and if\npossible get a statement from him on the situation.\nWhen I have further information I shall forward it to you immediately o\nCordially yours\nTank E.
