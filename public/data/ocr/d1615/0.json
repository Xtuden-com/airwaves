I have received a list\nfrom the Code Authority in Washington saying that approval has been given to the\napplication of the following members for exemption of the provisions of the codes\nWKAR Michigan State College, East Lansing, Michigan\nKPOF pillar of Fire, Denver, Colorado\nWAWZ pillar of Fire, Zarephath, New Jersey\nWILL University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois\nWLBL Department of Agriculture and Markets, Stevens Point, Wisconsin\nWOSU The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio\nWMBI The Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, Illinois\nKUSD University of South Dakota, Vermillion, South Dakota\nKFDY South Dakota State College, Brookings, South Dakota\nKWLC Luther College, Decorah, Iowa\nWCAT South Dakota State School of Mines, Rapid City, South Dakota\nWOI Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa\nWTAW Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, Texas\nWSUI State University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa\nKDAC Oregon State Agricultural College, Corvallis, Oregon\nWLB University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota\nWBAK Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Justice, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\nWCAD The St. Lawrence University, Canton, New York\nKSAC Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science, Manhattan, Kansas\nKSAJ Grove City College, Grove City, Pennsylvania\nWBAA Purdue University, LaFayette, Indiana\nKFSG The Angelus Temple Radio Beacon, Log Angeles, California\nKHPS Benson Polytochnic School, Portland, Oregon\nKWSC The State Collogo of Washington, Pullman, Washington\nThe monoy saved in this one pioco of work will pay our membership duos for more\nthan two yoars*"
