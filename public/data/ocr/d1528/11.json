  "text": "WOI SPORTS NEWS\nDale Williams, WOI sports announcer,\nhad quite a workout last month when he\ncovered college games and then wound up\nthe season with an endurance contest in\nthe covering of 16 basketball games in the\nstate boys’ championship rounds at Iowa\nCity.\nThrough special permission of the Fed¬\neral Communications Commission, Dale\nwas able to get in several night broad¬\ncasts of the Iowa State College cage con¬\ntests. Again, the FCC made it possible to\ncover all night games at Iowa City in the\nstate high school cage race.\nThis spring, Dale will be on hand for\nall of the broadcasts of the Iowa State Col¬\nlege baseball games which are played on\nSaturday afternoons at Clyde Williams\nfield. These will include the Minnesota\ngame on April 20, Kansas State on May\n4, Nebraska on May 11 and Iowa State\nTeachers on May 18.\nIn addition, Dale will travel to Manson,\nIowa, for the broadcast of the state high\nschool championship playoffs in that city.\nThis broadcast will wind up the baseball\nactivities for the spring.\nAt the present time it is expected that\na broadcast will be made from Clyde\nWilliams field here at Iowa State of the\nstate high school track and field meet.\nIowa State Baseball Schedule\nApril 5-6—Iowa State Teachers at Ce¬\ndar Falls.\nApril 12-13—Oklahoma at Norman.\nApril 19-20—Minnesota at Ames.\nApril 26-27—Nebraska at Lincoln.\nMay 3-4—Kansas State at Ames.\nMay 10-11—Nebraska at Ames.\nMay 17-18—Iowa State Teachers at\nAmes.\nMay 24-25—Missouri at Columbia.\nFARM FEATURES\nOver on this side of the page, Dale Wil¬\nliams changes from sports to farm editor.\nAlmost every farmer in Iowa is familiar\nwith Dale’s early-morning “Down on the\nFarm” program as well as with the after¬\nnoon “Farm Facts” program. Both feature\nspecialists in the various fields of agri¬\nculture.\nSpecialists from the college resident and\nextension staffs appeal1 on Dale’s programs\nto answer questions which have been asked\nby farmers. In addition, Dale features\nthese same specialists in timely subjects\nrelated to agriculture. He and his guests\nsuggest to farmers when to get ready for\nplanting crops, when to treat, when to\nharvest, and diseases and insects to watch\nfor once the crop is in. How to care for ma¬\nchinery and farm buildings and installa¬\ntions also have a part on Dale’s programs.\nIn short, Farm Editor Williams brings\nthe farmer one of the most complete farm\ninformation and feature programs obtain¬\nable. And it isn’t a dry program. Rather,\nit is spiced with plenty of humor—most\nof which is directed at Extension Editor\nC. R. Elder’s Maxwell, now deceased, and\nEngineer Mel Haas’ creative poetry at¬\ntempts on the program.\nFor information and for entertaining\ndoses of humor, stay turned to 640 on\nyour dial for the “Down on the Farm” pro¬\ngram from 6:15 to 7 o’clock in the morn¬\ning and the “Farm Facts” program from\n12 o’clock noon until 12:30.\nHIGHLIGHTS OF HISTORY\nEach Monday at 2:55 p. m. WOI\npresents highlights and explanations\nof the previous week’s major news\ndevelopment. Intended for use in\nIowa schools, the program probes be¬\nhind the news, in the belief that cur¬\nrent events are the last chapter of\nhistory, and in the preceding chap¬\nters lie explanations for develop¬\nments today."
