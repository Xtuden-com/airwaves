There is no\nbar to a licensee operating two educational stations\nin the same area.\nMAGNUSON BILL UNOPPOSED\nIN HOUSE COMMITTEE HEARING\nSenate-approved legislation authorizing $51,000,000\nto educational TV systems was rushed through a day-\nand-a-half hearing by the House Commerce trans¬\nportation and communications subcommittee last\nmonth, meeting no opposition. According to the\nJuly 19 Television Digest, however, outlook for final\napproval this year remained dim.\nThe subcommittee voiced few doubts as to the\nneed for federal aid in financing TV equipment pur¬\nchases by state and local bodies as proposed by the\nSenate ETV bill (S-2119) of Sen. Warren Magnuson\n(D-Wash.) and companion House measures (HR-\n12177 and HR-13297) which appeared at earlier\nSenate hearings.\nDespite anticipated speedy consideration of the\nETV proposals by the subcommittee, it was doubt¬\nful that legislation could be cleared for floor action\nbefore the scheduled August adjournment.\nDIRECTORY CHANGES\nP. 2 Delete:\nDelete:\nDelete:\nAdd:\nAdd:\nDelete:\nAdd:\nDelete:\nAdd:\nAdd:\nI 34 Active I\n97 Associate Members\n58 Affiliate Members\n(Approx.)\nIndustrial Associate Members\nI Sustaining Member\nRadio - AM only 10\nRadio - FM only 86\nRadio - AM & FM 7\nTV only 14\nTV, AM, & FM 5\nTV & FM 10\nTV & AM 2\nDue to operation of more than one station\n(Radio and/or Television) these 134 members\noperate, or have construction permits for 176\nstations.\nPresident: Dr. Burton Paulu\nStation KUOM\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nPast (from Frank E.
