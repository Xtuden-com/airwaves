  "text": "Journal for February 1955, “A Short History of\nTelevision Recording” by Albert Abramson. It con¬\ntains an excellent bibliography on television recording.\nOn writing to Mr. Abramson for permission to re¬\nprint his article, we discovered that the material it\ncontains is taken from his Electronic Motion Pic¬\ntures, published late in 1955 by the University of\nCalifornia Press. We suggest this book as recom¬\nmended reading for any television engineer, for it is\nreally a history of the television camera and con¬\ntains a very complete bibliography on the develop¬\nment of television equipment and processes.\nWe had the opportunity of meeting Mr. Abramson\nwho is employed by CBS-Television in Hollywood.\nHe graciously conducted Merlyn Rawson and me on\na very complete tour of the CBS Television facilities.\n*****\n“Is Portable Test Equipment Portable?” is the\ntitle of a short article in September 1957 Electronic\nIndustries and Tele-Tech. It’s a summary of a cur¬\nrent test equipment study being conducted at the\nU.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory in San Diego. The\nmilitary services have found that technicians fre¬\nquently will not use certain items of test equipment\nsimply because they are too large and bulky to carry\neasily.\nThe factors of weight, width, height and length\nwere investigated. On the basis of this investigation,\nthe maximum acceptable dimensions have been set\nat 8 inches wide, 18 inches by 18 inches long with a\nmaximum acceptable weight of 14 pounds. It’s good\nto know someone is making a study to determine what\nportable really means. Maybe this study will help\nbreak down the usual criterion of portability - “it\nhas handles.”\nMuch has been done in recent years to improve\nthe design of radio and television equipment for\nfield use. We can remember the old radio days when\namplifiers, mixers and volume indicator meters were\nbuilt as units on iron panels with audio transformers\nencased in iron cases and then packaged in oak cases\nan inch thick. Those too, were the days of battery\noperated amplifiers where you lugged a 6-volt A\nbattery and 180 volts of B battery, also in a sturdy\noak case, to the top of the stadium.\nThe present-day engineer can carry his transis¬\ntorized amplifier and the rest of his equipment in a\ncamera gadget bag or briefcase, ride to the heated\npress box in an elevator, plug the amplifier into the\nAC line, attach the broadcast line and he’s ready to\ncheck in on the business phone in the booth. “Good\nold days? Phooey.”\nSee how we have grown. The persons in this photo constitute most of the attendants of an NAEB Convention held at Purdue about 1941-\n42.
