The lamp house\nis then swivelled around to the position shown in Fig. 1(b)* The meter then\nreads per-cent reflectance directly. Two things are important when such a\ndevice is used for calibration. The cells must have the same color response\nas the image orthicon and the results obtained will only hold good under\nconditions of flat light.\nFor the readings to be interpreted, they must be related to the\nstandard RETKA gray scale and this has been done on the attached chart. The\ngray scales on the lithographed studio test pattern should not be used as a\nreference as they are somewhat inaccurate* Accurately calibrated sets of four\nsmall gray scales are available from RETKA and may be cemented over those on\nthe test pattern.\nTHE MUNSELL SYSTEM\nThe reflectometer is a valuable device for checking samples of\ncostumes, drapes and other properties but the problems of calibrating the\nthousands of color combinations possible with paint mixes becomes a difficult\none. Various systems for the description and cataloging of color have been\ndevised such as the Munsell system, the Ostwald system and others. Ihe most\nuseful one from the TV viewpoint is the Munsell system, where the relationship\nto the reflectance is obtainable.\nIn the Munsell system color is defined in three ways.\n(1) Hue - which is the visible color such as red, green, blue, etc.\nand is designated R, G, B, etc,\n(2) Value - which is the relative brightness of samples and may be\ntranslated into reflectance. It is designated by numbers\nfrom one to ten written thus 1/ 7/ 9/ and so on. The\ngradations in value represent equal visual differences."
