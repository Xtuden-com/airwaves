Ginsberg, project engineer for the new\nAmpex machine, prepared a paper which was presented May 2 at the\nConvention of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers\nin New York, The paper was presented by Ross H, Snyder and gave a\nbrief history of the project and a discussion of the applications\nfor which it was designed.\nSnyder emphasized that the machine was designed specifically\nfor the purpose of program delay. This explains why it first will\nbe used by CBS and NBC to overcome the 3 hour East-West time dif¬\nference. The use of video tape for this purpose will result in\nimproved quality of both picture and sound and reduced annual op¬\nerating costs.\nAnother point stressed in this paper was the fact that the\nusefulness of the video tape equipment for other purposes will be\ndetermined from the experience gained with the equipment in actual\noperation by the networks who have purchased prototype models\nfor delivery this summer, Ampex officials caution that too much\nmay be assumed too soon regarding its applications both within\nand outside the television industry.\nr"
