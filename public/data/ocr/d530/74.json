A con-\nsiderabla aisouat of work would appear to b© necessary before budgets adequate for\ntelevision station operation can bo developed in many such areas. Such budgets\nrange from 190,000.00 or so to §400,000.00 per year. It is expected that the?\nXST and 9QC» will provide these figures, although the MT?B is ready to provide\nthem for its member stations if necessary. (The MEB would like to state\nunequivocally that th© fact that it is, at Committee request, tho solo provider of\nbasic radio data for this report is not to be construed as absence of equal or\ngreater interest, involvement and concern in educational television.■\nIt appears to th© MSB, as the education&L station association for both\nradio and TV, -that tho growth of television, attar a first surge to gat what will\nin effect b© pilot stations on the air, is likely to be fairly gradual, as was\nthat of radio. For many years, for example, there were only some thirty educational\nradio stations. This perspective, if it differs from that of soas© of the other\ngroups represented, is tempered by and based on thirty years experience as an*\nassociation in an area in which unequal© budgets are usually only slowly achieved."
