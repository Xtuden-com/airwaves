This will\ngive some indication of the increasing volume of work and submissions which\noperation of the Network involves. The series for broadcast during the 195U-25>\nschool year were approved and are currently being distributed. The committee\nis currently auditioning series for broadcast during the 195>5>-£6 school year.\nThese series will be announced at the fall meeting of the committee just prior\nto the NAEB Annual Convention,\nThe committee held three meetings during the year. One was a sub-com¬\nmittee meeting held at Urbana, Illinois, where terms and standards used for\nvarious nschool\" programs were clarified. At the Columbus, Ohio, meeting in\nApril the committee issued a report of its accomplishments and a description\nof its purposes and aims (Exhibit 16),\nThe results of a survey by this committee, as reported more fully in the\nMay, 19$h NAEB Newsletter, show that close to one million children listen to\nNAEB in-school radio programs every week.\nYet another survey conducted by this committee through the NAEB Network\noffice concerned station reactions to those in-school program series thus far\ndistributed. Each in-school station was given a complete list of these series\nand asked to name those which they had found unsatisfactory, those which were\nsatisfactory, and those of which they would like to receive further programs.\nFurthermore, the stations were asked to list those areas in which they most\nneeded in-school programs. The purpose of this survey was, of course, to give\nthe committee a more solid basis for its decisions in regard to the series\ncurrently under consideration for future distribution."
