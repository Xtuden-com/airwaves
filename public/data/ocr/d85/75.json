SMATHERS, FLA.\nFebruary 24, 1967\nMr. Myron M. Curry\nDirector, KFJM & CCTV\nThe University of North Dakota\nGrand Forks, North Dakota 58201\nDear Mike:\nThank you very much for your letter. I appreciate your, kind\nremarks.\n•\nI have done a little investigating into the bill for educa¬\ntional radio facilities that you are working on, and I find\nyour situation not quite as favorable as it might have seemed.\nAt the staff level, Senator Magnuson's office said that the\nSenator will introduce the educational television facilities\nbill drafted in the White House, and that it was very unlikely\nthat this would include anything for educational radio.\nFrom here on in the game is pretty hard to call, but often\ntimes in these situations the Senator who has agreed to intro¬\nduce something asked in a presidential message has consulted\nwith the White House as to terms of the legislation. This\nSuggests that your organization should be concentrating its\nactivities on the White House and Senator Magnuson at the\nmoment.\nI tell you all this only in an effort to be helpful. This is\nall probably something that the professional staff of your\norganization already know. It may very well be that they are\nnow working closely with the White House.\nYours very truly\nJames G. Meeker\nLegislative Assistant to\nSenator Quentin N. Burdick\nJGM:w"
