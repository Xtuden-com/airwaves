ThIS, AS I 8ELIEVE\n1 SAID 8EF0RE, IS A VERY VALUABLE THING TO ME AND WELL \"'ORTH THE FIVE\nDOLLARS. I THINK YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME, HOWEVER, THAT TEN DOLLARS IS\nA RATHER HIGH PRICE FOR IT, AND YET 1 WOULD BE PLACED IN POSITION OF\nPAYING TEN DOLLARS FOR THIS News LETTER IF THE DUES FOR ASSOCIATE\nMEMBERS WERE INCREASED AS PROPOSED.\n\"I AM NOT OVERLOOKING THE OTHER VALUABLE FEATURES OF THE ASSOCIATION,\nSUCH AS THE EXCHANGE OF SCRIPTS, AND THE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH 1 FIND\nMOST ENJOYABLE, ANO A FEW OTHER FEATURES OF THIS NATURE« HOWEVER,\nWHEN AN INCREASE OF DUES IS PLANNED, THE MATTER SHOULD BE EVALUATED\nON THE BASIS OF THE DIRECT 8ENEFIT ONE RECEIVES AND, FOR THIS REASON,\nI WOULD VETO THIS INCREASE,\n\"In eASE THE THOUGHT COMES TO MIND, THAT WE SHOULD BE A FULL MEMBER\nBECAUSE OF OUR FM STATION, W8KY, uH1CH WILL BE ON THE AIR NOW WITHIN\nA MONTH, * WOULD NOT ACCEPT A FULL MEMBERSHIP ON THIS BASIS BECAUSE\nOF MY IDEA OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE BETWEEN OUR BROADCASTING OVER\nV»HAS AND OUR BROADCASTING ON OUR OWN FM STATION AT THE PRESENT TIME,\nOur FM station has been created simply to “get a foot in the ooor”,\nIF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, AND HOLD OUR LICENSE WHILE I SEE WHAT\nDEVELOPS IN THE ART, THERE ARE NOT MOPE THAN 300 FM RECEIVERS IN\nTHIS TERRITORY RIGHT NOW, SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE ”'0RK OF OUR STATION\nWILL COMPAPE IN IMPORTANCE WITH OUR WORK OVER WHAS IN WHICH WE AVERAGE\nA MILLION OR MORE LISTENERS TO OUR PROGRAM.”\nRegards\nYour Servant,\nPresident\nF£S:maj\nEnclosure"
