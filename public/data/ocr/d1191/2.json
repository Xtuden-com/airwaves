  "text": "-3-\nIt is important to note that none of these points has yet been tested as to its\nvalidity. HEW, in granting the NAACP request for extension, was acting only in a\nroutine procedural way; it was not acknowledging the appropriateness or\ninappropriateness of the issues raised. Because the request was withdrawn\nbefore comments were filed on these issues, there has been no opportunity for an\nexamination of their legality and relevance to the Act and its administration. It\nwould appear that many issues raised deal with programming, with which the\nFederal government is expressly forbidden to interfere. However, no legal\ndetermination on these matters will be made until a “test case”arises out of one\nof the comments. As you know, any interested party may come in with a comment\nwithin 30 days of the filing of the grant application. Following the close of the\ncomment, the applicant has ten days within which to file reply comments.\nHEW MAKES INITIAL GRANTS\nAs we go to press, word has been received of the first five grants to be made\nunder the ETV Facilities Act: S. C.
