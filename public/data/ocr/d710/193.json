For\nrecognition of the instruments and voices of the orchestra, a film or tele¬\nvision identifying the instrument and the tone it produces and identifying the\nsections of the orchestra and their functbns would be very satisfactory. For\nmusic appreciation tonal quality is the first consideration and for that\nreason the superior technical transmission of sound on the FM radio band makes\nradio preferable. Again, visual cues of an orchestra as the camera sweeps over\nthe players may detract from the enjoyment of music as an absolute.\nIn large measure the choice of radio or television as the educational medium\ndepends on the listeners or viewers. If they need concrete experiences to\nunderstand abstract ideas, give them television. If \"island” is the abstrac¬\ntion, then show them many islands to make a fully effective learning situation.\nIf verbalization is satisfactory, use it. The learner must make the jump\nbetween subjects, must make the proper associations, inferences and judgments.\nIf your educational goals are fully achieved by the medium employed then it is\nprobably satisfactory. For example, the University of Wisconsin's Let's Draw\nseries, is a highly successful radio program. Professor James A. Schwalbach,\nthe originator of the series, thinks some things are done better on radio than\non television because there is the danger that if drawings or patterns are\nshown on TV, the drawings turned in by student viewers will be imitative. Craft\nprograms requiring step by step development of processes can profit from tele¬\nvision.\nAs in radio programming a few well done programs should be preferred to many\npoorly done. And as in radio, many errors may be removed before the actual\nbroadcast by recording and editing on kinescopes.\nThe section dealing with television contains further suggestions pertinent to\nprogramming."
