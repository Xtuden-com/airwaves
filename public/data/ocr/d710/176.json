The radio-television educator, therefore, through the agency of the\nclassroom teacher must make sure that the educative act is completed at school\nlevels by obtaining acceptable responses from the listening group. At the\nnon-classroom level of listening, responses are more difficult to determine,\nbut the educational broadcaster cannot be effective unless he finds ways to\nsurvey his audiences and determine from their responses whether the educative\nact has taken place satisfactorily."
