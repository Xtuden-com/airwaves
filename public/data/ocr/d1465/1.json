He saysi ’The figures\nshould apply only to the station.’\nMIn answering his question I took pains to point out that the figure mentioned\nabove applied solely to the radio building, the transmitter, apparatus, etc.,\nwhereas the net worth of the university (at cost) at June 30, 1930, amounted to\n$25,117,353.67. (Now oateefcds twenty-seveft millions).\nwThe question in my mind is whether the Radio Commission has any adequate idea\nat all of what the modern educational institution is as to size, workings, and\nopportunity to take worth while information to the radio audience.\n”ln answering the questions raised by some of our friends, I have not only\nwritten our senators a couple of times, but I am sending the information asked\nfor in the Association’s special Bulletin of February 11, 1932.”\nWill you please take a few minutes’ time to write even a short note to this\noffice if you expect to cooperate with officers of the Association and submit\nthis material. We shall appreciate very much having this information by return\nmail in order that we may know just what action is to be taken relative to this\nparticular work.\nSincerely yours."
