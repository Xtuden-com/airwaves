  "text": "Mr. Kenneth Harwood\nUniversity of Southern California\nJanuary 10, 1958\n5 David Lewis, University of Oregon requests a grant-in-aid for a research ^\nproject In ‘\"me Teacher-Producer Relationship in Credit Courses for Television.\nMr. Lewis did not indicate any specific time for this study. AMOUNT: $400.00\n6. Jack McBride, University of Nebraska requests a grant for a project Involving\n“An Experiment Evaluating Television Discussion Techniques toward the Stimula¬\ntion of Community Processes\" to be conducted during the period of February 15\nto May 15, 1958. AMOUNT: $487.00\nWithout being more certain of the cost of the Research Seminar, we here may be\nsticking our necks out. But with this an Important project Harold and I are will¬\ning to risk allocating $1,500, instead of the $500 or $600 earlier mentioned. We\nmay end up with some deficits, but we think we can adjust somehow. I of course\nwish it were more. It would make your task easier.\nI'll expect word from you, as Chairman, only, after your committee has agreed\nwhich to grant, and how much. This may involve some correspondence, as it\ndid last year: Some can perhaps be cut down. Or you may want to grant fewer\nin full (or nearly in full). This I’ll leave to you, as we always must.\nCopies of this letter, and the attached materials, are going also to the other\nmembers of your sub-committee: Sam Becker, Irving Merrill, Hldeya Kumata\nand Raymond Cheydleur.\nIt’s now yours to work out. We handle notification and issuance of checks on the\nbasis of your recommendation .\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJS:jg\nEnclosures (5)\nCC: Messrs. Becker, Merrill, Kumata and Cheydleur"
