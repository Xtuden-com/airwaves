  "text": "Mr. Samuel L. Becker\nJanuary 13, 19^9\nPage 2\naiid I intend visiting these libraries to do preliminary research regarding this\nfilming project. With this groundwork done, X believe we can complete the volume\nof research we want in the time we've allowed.\n/As for the Wisconsin collection, we have been in contact with Mr. Thomas\nG. Lueders, Field Representative for the Wisconsin State Historical Society at\nMadison since October, 1958. Mr. Lueders has provided us with details of the\n\\ Mass Communications History Center Collection to July 10, 1957. Since I per-\nI sonally spend me summer vacations in that region of the country, I intend\nI visiting the Collection at Madison this summer to examine and photograph what\nh*.they have pertinent to this Radio History Slide Collection.\nAs you can see by these previous paragraphs, there is a great deal more\nresearch involved than is mentioned in the proposal we submitted to you and\nthe NAEB. If you feel it would be valuable to the sub-committee's evaluation\nof our prposal. I'll be happy to detail our complete plans — including the\nmajor contribution of research data that could be provided by an NAEB grant —\nand have them sent to you.\nAgain, my sincere thanks for your detailed letter. To this date we have\nreceived many favorable comments on the slide-lecture proposal; but few, if\nany, have offered any constructive ideas with regards to its method and limi¬\ntations. Your comments have been most welcome; and have been most helpful.\nIf I can provide you with any further information, please let me know.\nSincerely,\nRaymond T. Bedwell, Jr.,\nAssistant in Radio-TV"
