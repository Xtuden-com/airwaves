These appear in Table 18. This ratio indicates\nthat in the afternoon and evening for both radio and television, the ratio is uniform¬\nly greater for television at all hours. During the entire survey, an average of\n2. 02 persons were watching each television set and an average of 1.40 persons\nwere listening to each radio.\nTable 18\nRatio of Number of Persons Listening to Number of Sets\nin Operation for Radio and T.

Not\nonly is this procedure extremely unsound statistically but the final figures devel¬\noped would only be useful in gaining a very rough estimate of the relative listen-\nership to WBAA during a given fifteen minute period.
