We are also considering\nsubmitting some reports based on this study to the N.A.E.B. Journal and\nto Bob Summers and the Journal of Broadcasting. If these editors do not\nfind this report suitable to their publications, we shall look else¬\nwhere. Any help or suggestions you might give us would be appreciated.\nAgain, thank you very much for all your cooperation.\nSincerely yours.\nAMG/cla"
