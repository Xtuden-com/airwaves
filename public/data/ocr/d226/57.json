However, going by memory, this matter has been\nbrought up several times and the feeling was that if funds were\navailable, we would approve some sort of help.\nI talked to Harry S. about it last week, reminding him that in\nli$it of what has been said, perhaps Browne’s request should\nalso be included along with the other request-grants this year—-\nand then let the committee or sub-committee make a final de¬\ncision on it.\nSince Browne has been waiting for a definite answer for quite a\nfew months now, I would suggest that no matter how this is handled,\nhe is entitled to a positive decision in February.\nCordially,\nRaymond D.
