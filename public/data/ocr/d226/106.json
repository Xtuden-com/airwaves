Fawcett, President\nCOLUMBUS 10\nDEPARTJ<\nJuly 22, 1957\nDr* Harry Skomia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nli; Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI assume that by this time John Thayer*s expense state¬\nment for the study he made here of parental supervision of\ntelevision viewing of children in the Columbus area, under an\nNAE Lee Research Grant, has reached you; I believe that\nit was sent out about a week ago. I am sorry that Thayer was\nso late in getting the material completed and the necessary\nfinancial accounting taken care of, but I hope that no incon¬\nvenience to your office has resulted.\nIn a letter sent two or three weeks ago to Mr. Ron Kostka,\nI mentioned that copies of two or three other recent studies\nmade here would be sent your way, and a letter in reply from\nHarold Hill suggests that these materials be sent to you.\nAccordingly, I am enclosing copies of these studies, which you\nmay wish to stick away in your fil\nHBS/ifs"
