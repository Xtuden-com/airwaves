It is in the important area of\nLISTENING.\nThe problem basically resolves itself in two areas, both of which are closely\nrelated. 1- Identification of methods for retraining teachers in the art of listening.\n2- Development of procedures to promote the teaching and creation of\n\"good11 listening habits in children.\nThe Education Index indicates nothing of value to this proposal before 1930\nthrough the present. The Encyclopedia of Education Research, I960 edition,\nindicates ’’the implication appears to be that the direct teaching of listening\nis necessary.”\nIf you are interested in such a proposal and would care to examine it,\nI would be pleased to submit it for your perusal*\nDirector, Audio-Visual Center and\nAssociate Professor of Education\nDMS:eb"
