As you can see,\nI have combined the original announcement with the instructions.\nBelieve that this might produce better results — eliminating\nthe extra operation.\nI substituted my name for Cheydleur1 s but put your address.\nThink it would be most efficient for these things to come to\nUrbana. As far as I am concerned you can even put your name\non the thing rather than mine.\nI will send at a later date a list of people or departments\nother than HAEB’ers to whom it would probably be well to send\ncopies of this announcement.\nBest,\nSam L. Becker\nChairman, NAEB\nResearch Committee\nSLB: mw\nEnds."
