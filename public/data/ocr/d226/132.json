The list continues to grow. Yet,\nthis represents only a very small segment of the field of education\nin the United States. There are thousands of educational institutions\nwhich have had no contact with educational television whatever. More\nimportant, perhaps, is the fact that there are hundreds of thousands\nof teachers who have had no experience with teaching by television,\neither in work ng in the medium themselves or merely seeing teaching\ncarried on over television.\nThe utilisation of television for teaching is expanding. More\nand more teachers will suddenly find themselves cast in the role of\ntelevision performer as well as teacher* The success of their entry\ninto television classrooms will vitally effect the future of educational\ntelevision, perhaps of education itself in our country. It need hardly\nbe added that If this Is true, then the destiny of our country also\nhinges upon the success of this meeting of teacher and camera.\nVery often this introduction is made by a television producer,\nwho adds his knowledge as a person trained and experienced In television\nto that of the teacher as an educator to bring about the resulting\ntelevised education. This is not always the case, however, for someÂ¬\ntimes there is no television producer, and producers, when present,\nvary as much as the personalities of men.\nWhat, then, is the best way of introducing the teacher to television?"
