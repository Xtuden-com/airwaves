Almost a fourth of all Minnesota children at the\nkindergarten and elementary level (128,000) are in schools without radio,\ncentral sound system or tape recording equipment. The largest number of these\nchildren attend ungraded schools. Thus, the most isolated children have the\nleast opportunity to listen to the Universityâ€™s school-directed radio programs,\nPaulu pointed out.\nAlthough free tape recording is provided as a state service, not more\nthan two per cent of the pupils in schools equipped with a tape recorder\nlistened to a Minnesota School of the Air program.\nIn the spring of 1957, 50 per cent of the pupils in public elementary\nschools in Minneapolis, 27 per cent of those in St. Paul and 6 per cent of\nthose in the suburban area had access to a television set in school.\nThe Minnesota School of the Air, which brings 10 regular programs and\nsome special broadcasts each week to schools in Minnesota and western Wisconsin,\nwas founded in 1938.\n-UN3-"
