These are:\nConstitution\nIn accordance with the procedures\nagreed upon at our Chicago meeting\nin October, the AER Constitution\nCommittee, headed by Dr. Belmont\nFarley, has redrafted the proposed\nConstitution for our organization. All\nwritten suggestions received from\nmembers as well as those made at the\nChicago meeting were considered in de¬\ntail by this committee. The copies of\nthe new draft were sent to the Execu¬\ntive Committee for review, and were\nreturned to the AER Constitution\nCommittee by February 10. You will\nreceive a copy of this revised Constitu¬\ntion with the April issue of the Jour¬\nnal.\nThe Constitution will be thorough¬\nly reviewed at the general meeting of\nAER members in Columbus May 2. If\nyou cannot attend the meeting, will\nyou make certain that your comments\nreach me by April 20, so that due con¬\nsideration may be given to each sug¬\ngestion. No formal action will be taken\nat the meeting in Columbus, but as soon\nas possible after that meeting, a final\nrevision will be forwarded to you and\na vote on its adoption taken by mail.\nThis careful consideration of the Con¬\nstitution should insure a document\nthat will definitely meet our objectives\nand provide for a well working or¬\nganization.\nElections\nDr. Franklin Dunham, chief of\nradio, U. S. Office of Education, has\nagreed to act as chairman of the Elec¬\ntion Committee this year. You will be\nasked to vote for the following nation¬\nal officers: President, Vice Presidents,\nSecretary, and Treasurer, and for the\nregional presidents in the Southwestern\nPacific and Southeastern areas.\nThe following schedule regarding\nelections has been approved:\nNominating ballot mailed out from\nthe National Office at Chicago,\nFebruary 10.\nNominating ballot to be returned to\nElection Committee, Washington,\nD. C., postmarked not later than\nMarch 1.\nCandidates notified of their nomina¬\ntion.\nFinal ballot mailed to members,\nMarch 22.\nBallots returned to Washington,\nD. C., postmarked not later than\nApril 5.\nI am sure we all realize the import¬\nance of this election and I trust that\nyou will meet the deadlines listed above,\nso that your choice for officers may be\ncounted.\nCanada-United States\nTranscription Series\nSeveral of the contributing groups\nfor this series have asked for an ex¬\ntension of time in order to insure a\nbetter production. Therefore, the dead¬\nline for all scripts in this series has\nbeen extended to March 15.\nWord comes that the St. Louis\ngroup made a gala affair of the record¬\ning of their contribution to this series.\nUnder the leadership of Dorothy\nBlackwell, the script was recorded be¬\nfore an audience of teachers in the\nPlayhouse of Station KMOX, Febru¬\nary 27. The meeting was in conjunc¬\ntion with their State Conference.\nIf any of you who have not been\ncontacted would like to contribute to\nthis series, will you please so notify\nus so that details may be worked out.\nSeminar for AER Members\nIt is proposed that a seminar for\nAER members be held at the Univer¬\nsity of Wisconsin July 28 to August 6.\nSufficient time will be given for a close\nexamination of publicity materials,\nindividual programs, and policies set\nup in each community.\nSince the number to be accommo¬\ndated must in some measure be re¬\nstricted, will you notify Harold B.\nMcCarty immediately if you are in¬\nterested. Expenses will be at a mini¬\nmum and you may rest assured that\nthe finest authorities in the country\nwill be on hand for consultations.\nSummer Institutes\nWhen you are planning your sum¬\nmer institute, will you set aside an AER\nDAY and send us the proposed date\nas soon as possible? It is hoped that\nrepresentatives from the AER may be\nable to visit you at that time.\nUtilization Procedures\nWe agreed at our AER meeting last\nOctober that Utilization Procedures\nshould be sent to the Chicago School\nBroadcast Conference by June 1. Let\nus have a wide representation of en¬\ntries this year. This is one way in\nwhich we can share our ideas.\nInstitute for Education by Radio,\nColumbus, Ohio\nThe following dates have been fixed\nfor the AER meetings in conjunction\nwith the Columbus Institute:\nMay 1—Executive Meeting [Open\nM eeting] —7:00-10:00 p .m.\nMay 2—Business Meeting [All\nMembers]—10:00-12 :00 a.m.\nMay 3—AER Luncheon—12:00\nnoon.\nDetails of these meetings will be\ngiven you in the April issue of the\nAER Journal, but may I suggest that\nyou jot these dates on your calendar\nnow. It is time also to encourage other\nmembers of your administration and\nfriends of radio in your area to join us\nat this meeting. We should have repre¬\nsentatives from every section of the\ncountry.\nI trust that you will take time to\nweigh carefully the matters listed above\nand make a special effort to send me\nyour reactions.\nSincerely,\nKathleen N. Lardie\n[102]\nTHE JOURNAL OF THE AER"
