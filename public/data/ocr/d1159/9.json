However, it should be\npointed out that no frequencies are available for new AM stations except\nfor daytime operation only* For adult education and in order to cover\nthis area, now inadequately covered at night, it is imperative that we\nsecure a station with night-time coverage, available now only with FM.\nHowever, in making plans for our own station, we find that network\nauthorities, the FCC, and most engineers, even those of RCA which at\nfirst vigorously opposed FM for various and obvious reasons not requir¬\ning enumeration here, are now predicting that FM will definitely sup¬\nplant AM broadcasting in a fewr years. Predictions range from the re¬\nplacement of all but a negligible number of AM stations by FM within\n5 years, to more conservative estimates to the effect that there will\nmerely be more FM than AM stations and listeners within 5 years.\nSven persons with heavy investments in AM facilities are applying\nfor FM stations. All the present Indianapolis station owners, plus\nseveral new broadcasters for example, have applied for FM stations in\nthe Indianapolis area, for FM provides new frequencies, more desirable\nthan those available on AM, which by its nature, limits the number of\nstations which may broadcast without interference* The four networks\nare organizing separate FM networks and planning a gradual complete\nchange-over to FM. FM also is a step in the direction of television,\nsince sound for television is best broadcast by FM, rather than AM*\nNo television station in America to our knowledge, uses AM for sound\ntransmission.\nHaving entered the radio field late, the radio stations in Indiana\ndid not receive the more desirable frequency and power assignments."
