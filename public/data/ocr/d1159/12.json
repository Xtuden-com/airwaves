  "text": "-11-\nPart IV\nJUSTIFICATION OF REQUEST FOR 50 KW FM STATION INSTEAD OF\nYfr kw'as previously suggested\n1. At the time we sent in our original application, in Feb*, 1944, the\nFCC had set aside certain channels for FM educational stations - but\nonly for a power up to 1 KW, except that if this would mean inade¬\nquate coverage, such institutions might apply for 3, 5 or 10 KW power\nThe 10 KW we applied for then was the maximum power for which we\ncould apply with any hope of our licensed being granted under the\nFOG rules as then set up.\n2. As of October, 1944, the FCC has removed these limits on the power\nof proposed FM educational stations. Nov/, for the first time, we\nare permitted to apply for a 50 KW station, just as any commercial\nbroadcaster may do.\n3* In addition to changing their rule, the FCC in October, 1944, also\nestablished a precedent. They approved the University of Michigan*s\napplication, immediately amended from 10 to 50 KW, granting the\nfirst educational FM license of 50 KW.\n4. It is the opinion of competent engineering authorities that we might\nreach Indianapolis and the largest population area of the state with\na 10 KW station, but that this is doubtful. We therefore believe it\nour duty to the State and the University, in view of our disadvanta¬\ngeous geographical location, (as compared to mountain-top locations\nfor example) to apply for the maximum in power (50 KW) and antenna\nheight (according to a competent engineer) to get all the coverage\ngood equipment and antenna location can give us.\n5. 50 KW will also make us as powerful as any other station now planned\nin the state, and will make us a key station in the proposed Indiana\neducational network"
