  "text": "-7-\nB, Engineering Department (Headed by Chief Engineer)\n1. Chief Engineer, fully licensed ~ responsible to Station\nDirector.\n2. Engineer (Full-time, licensed.)\n3. Two half-time student engineers.\nNOTE: By keeping the studios and transmitter in the same building, no\nmore engineers should be necessary. Two must be on duty for all\nthe time we are on the air (one in control room, one at transmitter\npanel) plus approximately 2 hours, (tests before opening each\nmorning; reports after closing each evening) plus one for each\nremote broadcast for any special event being transmitted. By\nrunning direct lines to classrooms, a separata engineer for\neach regular classroom or out-of-studio broadcast can be avoid¬\ned, and further salaries saved.\nC. secretaries: One for the Station Director, one for the Program\nDirector, and one as receptionist and switchboard operator, in\naddition to personnel previously listed. The heavy volume of\ncorrespondence, typing and stenciling scripts, and keeping com¬\nplete files of scripts, transcriptions, and legal files, together\nwith the mailing of schedules, make at least the above secretarial\nassistance a necessity the first year.\n\\"
