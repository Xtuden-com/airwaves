JUNE 1, 1940®..Page 4\ncommercial educational broadcasting stations are given the new frequ~\nencies 42*100* 42*300* 42,500* 42,700 and 42,900 kilocycles® This\nprovides a continuous band for FM, thus assuring a degree of uni¬\nformity in the quality of the different frequency modulation channels\nand tending toward simplicity and economy of FM receiving sets®\nThe rearrangement permits the Commission to maintain seven television\nchannels below 108*000 kilocycles and at the same time provide an\nadequate number of channels for frequency modulation,, It expects\nthese and other services to benefit by the changes*\nIt points out that sky wave interference on frequencies immediately\nbelow 508000 kilocycles is greater than on the higher frequencies*\nAhile it likewise recognizes that shadows and fading become more\npronounced as the frequency increases* it nevertheless believes that\nsuch factors are not substantially different on frequencies in the\nvicinity of 00*000 kilocycles* Furthermore* it i<fc generally conceded\nthat the problem of diathermy interference is now most acute on\nfrequencies immediately below 50,000 kilocycles® Thus* by allocating\n60,000 to 66,000 kilocycles instead of 44,000 to 50,000 kilocycles\nto the television service, a good balance has been achieved betv/een\nthe effects of sky waves and diathermy interference on the lower\nfrequencies and &he effects of shadows and fading on the higher bands®\nThe miscellaneous radio services now assigned frequencies between\n132,000 and 140,000 kilocycles will benefit by the changes in that\n9,000 kilocycles are now allocated where formerly only 8,000 kilocycles\nwere available* This can provide 70 channels as compared with 57\nchannels in the past® The change has the further advantage of\nproviding two large blocks of frequencies for experimentation with\ndifferent propagation character1stics®\n*TIn considering these changes,” explains the Commission, fIt was\nnecessary to weigh the particular needs and problems of the various\nnon-Federal services as well as the Government’s requirements, and to_\ndetermine the permissibility of the allocation under our international\nundertakings; also to have regard for the future of radio operation\nin the services involved, from an international standpoint, so far as\ncould be foreseen® The changes should result in improved service for\nall stations which are affected by the Commission*s order and will\nfully meet the varied situations presented of a national and inter¬\nnational charactero”\nThe Commission gives formal expression of its appreciation for the\nsplendid cooperation and assistance rendered by the Government\ndepartments and agencies and by members of the Interdepartment Radio\nAdvisory Committee in helping to solve this difficult problem*\nThousands of Government station assignments hod to be shifted*\nURGES CONTINUANCE OF FUNDS FOR RADIO ACTIVITIES OF\nprargET -- ~ ~\nBelieving that Congressional failure to appropriate ;40,000 for\ncontinuance of radio activities within the Office of Education, was\nimminent, the Executive Secretary sent the following telegram to\nthe chairman and members of the Senate appropriations committee on\nMay 29ths"
