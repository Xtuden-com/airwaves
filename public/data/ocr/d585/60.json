I presume you refer to the Columbia\nBroadcasting System and not Columbia University.\nIf it Is CBS, why not find out what they have\nin mind and let them make the proposal.\nThe ASCAP business isn’t rushing and we oan\nwait until Gene Buck returns.\nYes, I got your notloe on the American Music\nFestival. Thanks a lot.\nCordially,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES/rep\nEnclosure"
