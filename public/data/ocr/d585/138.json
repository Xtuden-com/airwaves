Sehooley\nExecutive Secretary\nN.A.I.B.\nStation WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbane, Illinois\nDear Frank!\nI thought you might be interested to see this\nitem - WNYC awarded a citation by Billboard Magazine for\n\"outstanding service\".\nTwo years ago I addressed a session of the New\nYork University Summer Hadio Workshop, and it has proved\nfruitful for WNYC. This summer we have four volunteers here,\none from Alabama, one from Vassar, one from Wisconsin and one\nHutchens of the Times spoke with me about — they're all here\nworking in the particular field they want to develops and I\ndo hope they gain the experience which will be of help to\nthem when they return to their respective schools# and stations.\nBy the way, don’t be disturbed about the FCC order\nfor a rehearing in our case. That was brought about by the decision\nof the Supreme Court due to the Denver-Boston decision. The Court felt\nthat the hearing should have been granted Denver (in that case, NBC\nnever showed up at the hearing—the reason for that, I'm sure you\nunderstand, since two Blue stations were involved.) Much as they\nare interested in the clear channel idea, they weren't going to\njeopardize two of their important Blue stations, Boston and Cleveland.\nWe had our pre-hearing conference session and it was agreed that we\nare to stay on until ten o'clock for at least thirty days after the\nhearing is held. I wanted you to know this so that you don't lose\nfaith in the Commission.\nVery sincerely yours.\nMSN:sd\n‘New York City's Own Station\"—830 Kc."
