I volunteered my services and was accepted\nby the Committee to take over the job.\nI am confident that it can be done for I know\nthat the Information people of the Commission are looking for\nassistance. We have worked out a very satisfactory program idea\nfor WNYC and I haven’t any doubt that I can work out something\nsimilar for all of our groups. I hope you haven't advised them\nof our official action as yet so that you can incorporate the\nExecutive Committee action when you do write them.\nSincerely yours,\nDirector\nMSN:c\n‘New York City’s Own Station”—810 Kc."
