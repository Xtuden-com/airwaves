Novik\nDirector, WNVC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nNew York 7, New York\nDear NovikJ\nThanks roR your note or January 31.\nToo, MY APOLOGIZES FOR NOT GIVING YOU SOME DOPE ON THE\nNAEB POSITION REGARDING FM . HOWEVER, AS CHAIRMAN JAMES t. Fly\nWAS TOLD BY ONE H. B. McCaRTY, THE POSITION OF EDUCATIONAL\nINSTITUTIONS WITH REGARD TO FM APPLICATIONS IS NO WORSE THAN\nTHAT OF THE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. PROPORTIONATELY AS MANY\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE APPLIED FOR FM LICENSES AS HAS\nTHE COMMERCIAL GROUPS. Or, I FEEL CERTAIN THAT THE PROPORTION\nOF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS APPLYING FOR FM IS EVEN GREATER\nTHAN THE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF COMMERCIAL INTERESTS INCLUDING\nALL FIELDS, NOT NECESSARILY BROADCASTING.\nWE ARE OPERATING OUR FM STATION ON A LIMITED SCHEDULE\nEACH WEEK. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT FEEL IT IS WORTH THE EXPENDITURE\nTO OPERATE FOR THE 18 RECEIVERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. % ARE IN\nTHE COUNTRY AND THAT * S ONE THING THE BOVS IN WASHINGTON AND\nNew York overlook regarding FM. In my own humble opinion, it\nWILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE FM MAKES HEADWAY IN RURAL AREAS.\nFrom our own point of view we are concerned with covering the\nstate or Illinois. On the other hand, I do think school systems\nwithin station areas should plan to make some use or FM IF IT is\nDESIRABLE TO USE RADIO AS A SUPPLEMENTARY AID IN EDUCATION.\nCORDIALLY,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFESimau"
