Hovik, General Manager,\nRadio Station «f H T C\nNew York City\nDear Mr, Hoviks\nIn further reference to ay previous correspondence\nconcerning Broadcast uaic, Inc., X fear there is one point I\nhave not siade perfectly clear. I want to take this opportunity\nto emphasize that we desire very much to have non-eornercial sta¬\ntions, such as yours, as neuters of Broadcast Music, even though\nat the present time they pay no fee to A3CAP,\nHot paying an ASOAP fee, you would not be required\nto subscribe to any stock in Broadcast Music in order to take ad¬\nvantage of the plan* Me shall be very glad to issue a license to\nyour station for the sum of one dollar (fl.oo), which will entitle\nyou to play any and all Broadcast Music selections.\n.vhile you are not a com ereial station, ana do not\nhave an ABO A3? lie nee, I feel sure that as a member of the radio\nindustry, you are interested in its general ’elhrej and that,\neven thou h it does not affaet you personally, you would not want\nto see this industry continue to be burdened by a monopoly, as at\npresent. It is only through a united front that it is possible\nfor the Industry to fight this monopoly, and your moral support,\nproved by the fact that you hold a Broadcast !3usie LloenseV will\nbe of sr at value to us all at this tine.\nI* therefore, look forward to receiving from you in\nthe near future a check for your Lie-nee fee of one dollar (21.00).\ntogether with the enclosed two copies of the License Agreement,\nproperly executed. *\nTrusting that we may have your cooperation in this\nvital matter, I am,\nVery truly yours,\n(signed) mm,i£ Mmsa\nSeville Miller.\nKK/la."
