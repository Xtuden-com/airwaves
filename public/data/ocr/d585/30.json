ASOAP might stipulate\nthat no selection is to be leyed more than onoe each u&y,\nexcept portions which might be uped as themes *t beginning\nand ending of any given program.\nFuthermore, It seems to ne if ABCAP would grant us this\nprivilege, expenditures for sending NAKB station copies of the\nrestrioted lists front time to time might be saved.\nIf you deem it advisable, I shall be glad to *rite directly\nto Mr. Buck, but I believe your discussion with him sight\nbe more desireble.\nIf ASCAP agrees to the suggestion, I believe » written state¬\nment for publication in the News letter would be desirable#\nCordially yours,\nFrank E# Bohooley"
