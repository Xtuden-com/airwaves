I suggest that you hand this\nmaterial to your publicity officer to make brief summaries for use in the press\nof your state. This is important as we expect to get support from a large part\nof the press, particularly the papers that are not themselves owners of Or af¬\nfiliated in any way with broadcasting stations*\nFor your convenience I am enclosing a stenographic report of Dr. Crane's pre¬\nsentation before the Federal Communications Commission on May 16 and a copy of\nEDUCATION BY RADIO, volume 5, no. 6, May 16, 1935, which contains his address\nas it was presented at Columbus, Ohio. I am enclosing a 16-page green pamphlet\ngiving information about the National Committee on Education by Radio. A brief\noutline of the proposal for a Federal chain will be found in this pamphlet on\npages 10 and 11. Finally, I am enclosing a clip sheet which may be helpful in\nthe press publicity to which I have referred.\nThe next most important step is for you to give adequate publicity to this plan in\nevery possible way thru the press and by public addresses in your community.\nWe believe the plan has much merit and few, if any, objections. There is no\nconflict with the present broadcasters since the proposed broadcasting system does nPt\nsupplant, but supplements the radio work that is now being done. We hope it will\nbe possible for Dr, Crane to appear at our September meeting of the National Asso¬\nciation of Educational Broadcasters. In the meantime, do all that you can to\nstudy this plan and give publicity to its proposals.\nYours very truly\nW. I. Griffith\nPresident - NAEB\n4 Enclosures"
