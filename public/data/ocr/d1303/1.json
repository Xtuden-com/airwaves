The manual de¬\nscribes WETA’s successful use of direct\nmail advertising to sell $10 annual mem¬\nberships, and includes samples of the mate¬\nrials used. First reactions from other ETV\nstations have been enthusiastic.\nIthaca Study Tour\nIthaca College’s radio-TV department is\norganizing a second annual comparative\nmass media study tour abroad. Students\nwill be able to study systems in several Eu¬\nropean countries, with visits scheduled for\nMadrid, Munich, Vienna, Moscow, East\nand West Berlin, and London. Departure is\nset for June 1 for the six-week course,\nwhich will be led by Royal D. Col'le, de¬\npartment chairman.\nDuring the present academic year, over a\nhundred 60-minute programs will be broad¬\ncast over the Ohio Medical Education Net¬\nwork, which includes 14 FM radio stations\nand 54 hospitals in Ohi'o and West Vir¬\nginia. Five times each week at noon, pro¬\ngrams are broadcast which are live two-\nway discussions between home community\nphysicians and medical school teachers on\nsubjects vital to continuing medical educa¬\ntion.\nTeaching physicians from medical schools\nin Ohio, New York, and North Carolina\nare heard talking with community physi¬\ncians on topics such as Contact Sports, Em¬\nphysema, Diabetes, Pericarditis, Hemiplegia,\nRheumatic Fever, Dermatology, Ulcers,\nNewborn Problems, jaundice, and Cancer.\nThe immediacy of these programs and the\nfact that they can be heard by the general\npublic help overcome the communications\nlag. Moreover, the program materials—\nslides, outlines, reprints and magnetic tapes\n—all reinforce and extend the utilization\nof the programs into medical libraries and\nhospital teaching clinics. Following broad¬\ncast the programs and slides are also made\navailable on tapes in the Ohio State Univer¬\nsity Autodidactic Library in the College of\nMedicine for use of medical students and\npracticing physicians.\nThe Center for Continuing Medical Edu¬\ncation at Ohio State University created the\nOhio Medical Education Network (OMEN)\nPublications\n• In the September Newsletter we an¬\nnounced the availability of copies of the\nproceedings of the Tokyo School Broad¬\ncasting Conference from the Japan Broad¬\ncasting Corporation. It has since come to\nour attention that those ordering the books\nmust pay the cost of the postage. One read¬\ner has informed us that this amounts to\n$6.20.\n• A few copies remain at the NAEB\nPublications Office, Urbana, of William\nParke’s simple manual for first-timers on\nTV. While the supply lasts, copies of the\n15-page mimeographed “Your Appearance\non TV” are obtainable for 50c each (25c\neach for orders of six or more mailed to\none address at one time). Payment must ac¬\ncompany order.\n• Reports of the UNESCO regional sem¬\ninar on the Role of Schools and Universi¬\nties in Adult Education, held in Sydney,\nAustralia, in January, 1964, may be obtained\nfrom 256 Flinders Street, Melbourne, Vic¬\ntoria, Australia. $1 each post free, 50c each\nfor ten or more.\nto help meet the problem of getting the\nfindings and applications of medical re¬\nsearch from the teaching centers to the\npracticing physician and his patient. Con¬\nceived in late 1961, OMEN came into exist¬\nence in October 1962 with two FM radio\nstations broadcasting the two-way programs\nand involving twelve hospitals in central\nOhio. In its first three years OMEN pro¬\ngrams produced nearly 25,000 registered at¬\ntendances in hospitals and an additional\n15,000 are expected in the current academic\nyear. Uncounted are the many physicians\nand the general public who listen in offices,\nhomes, or automobiles.\nWOSU-FM is the key station in the net¬\nwork, originating all programs. Much of\nthe credit for the net must go to A. J. Bog-\ngioni, chief engineer of WOSU radio, who\ndesigned and executed the technical func¬\ntion, and to William Steis, general manager,\nand Richard B. Hull, director of telecom¬\nmunications, for their leadership and judg¬\nment.\nAuthorized for continuation study credit\nby the American Academy of General Prac¬\ntice, the network is supported i*n part by\ngrants from the Merck Sharp and Dohme\nPostgraduate Program and the American\nCancer Society. Across the country, the two-\nway technique is now being used by five\nother medical institutions and serves par¬\nticipating physicians in fifteen states.\nPERSONNEL ^\n^ George L.
