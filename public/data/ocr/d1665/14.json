Treat radio-received information the same as all other—include\nit in tests, examinations, etc.\n8. Provide retention by discussions, keeping of note-books, projects,\netc.\n9. Foster home discusssion of broadcasts heard by both home and\nschool.\n10. Give us every suggestion for the improvement of the broadcasts.\nSince man in a few hundred centuries has traveled from the lonely\nsavages in the upland caves to the engineer and chemist and psychologist\nof today, it is not difficult for me to believe that in a little time our\nrace, moving necessarily in the direction of its innate promptings, will\nenter upon a life that will be broad and gracious and lovely and beau¬\ntifully eventful beyond anything we can dream of now or desire.\n—H. G. Wells.\n-12-"
