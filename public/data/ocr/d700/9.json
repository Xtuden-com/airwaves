Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n3ii Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry}\nI have just received copies of those letters from the University\nof Houston and The Albuquerque Public Schools with reference to\ntheir nominees for the Research Seminar.\nI don’t like to set administrative policies that can’t be changed\nwhen needed, however, this material is so late that if we make an\nexception on this, we would have to do it on all the other late\napplications. The final list has been made up and will be in the\nhands of the committee members on Tuesday morning) it would delay\nthe returns, even if I could hold them up at this late date, if\nanother and revised list was sent out.\nIn view of the fact that I feel it essential to get the master list\nto you and Tyler, since it will take considerable time to contact\nthe selected nominees and to firra-up those acceptances, I will sticl\nby the September 25, Tallahassee, deadline, unless some truly ex¬\nceptional conditions arise.\nSincerely,\nRaymond D. Cheydleur, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\nRDCsas\nc.c. I Keith Tyler"
