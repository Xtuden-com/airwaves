I would like very\nmuch to have Dr. John K. Folger, our Associate Director for\nResearch, to take part in the NAEB Research Seminar in Ohio in\nDecember. You asked for some indication of his \"qualifications\".\nI am enclosing a biographical sketch.\nDr. Folger has handled most of our staff efforts concerning the pro¬\nposed tri-state pilot network project and the exploration of the\nregional network during the past few months. He could make, I be¬\nlieve, a real contribution to the Seminar.\nWhat are the dates of the Seminar? I do not know Dr. Folger*s\nDecember schedule and he is out of town at the present time but\nhe probably could arrange to attend.\nWith personal regards and best wishes, I am\nRCA:is\nDirector\ncc: Dr. John K. Folger"
