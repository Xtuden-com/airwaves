Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Bob:\nI have been looking over the proposed November 18th draft\nof the agreement between the NAEB and Kent State. Here are\na few reactions.\nI would suggest rephrasing the first paragraph as follows\n(additions or alterations are underlined for quick spotting):\n\"1* Kent State University would be the exclusive distributor\n(other than aa indicated below) for non-broadcast\npurposes ot ail taped radio programs produced under\ngrants from the Educational Television and Radio\nCenter (except those excluded in writing by the\nEducational Television and Radio Center or the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters).\nThe producer, the eJtRcJ and the 'HAES shall each also\nhave the right to make its own distribution from\ntime to time, when warranted by justifiable circum¬\nstances.”\nI should assume that \"Kent State University\" Is singular;\nif so, then 1A should read \"Kent State University will charge its....*\nI am not quite clear as to need for point IB. Why should\nthey list any programs In their catalog except those which they\ndistribute? And don*t the other sections of this agreement\nindicate which of our programs they can distribute? This I\nthink should be sharpened up or omitted.\nIn paragraph 2, reference is made to the fact that the\nprograms will be \"coded\" by Kent State University. Here again\nI am not quite clear as to the purpose of the statement. Why do\nwe care whether or not they are \"coded\"?"
