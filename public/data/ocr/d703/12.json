In Paragraph one, what do\nYOU MEAN BY \"HOLDING\" FOR THIS CHANGE?\nMarguerite Fleming and one or two others oppose letting their\ntapes go to Tape Repository. My ideas (and I think ScHooLEYfs)\nARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS YOURS, I BELIEVE, THOUGH l*VE\nHAD TO READ YOURS HASTILY IN THE \"BETWEEN TRIPS\" STAGE.\nIâ€™VE REASSURED MANY PEOPLE BY THE EXAMPLE YOU, McKOWN AND OTHERS\nHAVE GIVEN. MAYBE WE*LL HAVE TIME TO TALK A BIT MORE IN DETROIT.\nRegards,\nHJSscr\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
