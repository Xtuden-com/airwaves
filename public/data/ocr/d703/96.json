WELCH\nAdminstrative Assistant\nAs you probably know in the past AERT and DAVI have had a\nJoint Radio and Recordings Committee one of the major projects\nof which has been the setting up of the tape recording services\nfor schools.\nMembership on this Committee expired: at the time'of the DAVI\nConvention. The DAVI Executive Committee has voted to continue\nthis Committee and to request that the joint nature be continued*\nSince the merger of AERT and NAEB I assume that you are the person\nto whom I should write concerning this matter. If your organiza¬\ntion desires to continue the co-sponsorship of this Committee we\nwould like for you to suggest a co-chairman from your organization\nand appropriate members for the Committee. DAVI has asked Dr.\nRalph H. Hall to continue as their Chairman for this Committee.\nOn page six of the new Tape Recording Catalog is a list of the\nprevious members. I have checked the names of those in the copy\nwhich is enclosed who were representatives of AERT. Probably\nthe two most active of these have been Gertrude Broderick and\nGale R. Adkins. I would suggest that the co-chairman be one of\nthe people who has had experience as a participant on the Committee\nin the past.\nI will appreciate your comments and suggestions.\nSincerely,\nO'\nAnna L. Hyer\nAssociate Executive Secretary\nALHsJMC\nEnclosure\ncc : Dr. Robert deKieffer\nDr. Ralph H. Hall"
