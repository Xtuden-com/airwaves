G.\nDear Ann:\nThank you for your letter of June 25 requesting a complete listing of\nour available programs.\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of our operation, we do not retain a\nlisting of programs such as your catalog for the National Tape Repository.\nHowever, we do have a list for office purposes, and I am enclosing a\ncopy of it for your use. As you will see by the \"Erased\" after many\nseries, we do not have masters of all programs. Also, the \"S\" proceedÂ¬\ning certain serial numbers means that series is an in-school production.\nIf you wish further information (such as originating stations, etc.) about\nany series, please contact me. I hope this will be of help to you.\nSincerely,\nRobert E. Underwood, Jr.\nNetwork Manager\nREUiwc\nEhc."
