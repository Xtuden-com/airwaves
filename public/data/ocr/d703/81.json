Since we do not allow\nany of our master tapes to go beyond the confines of this building, we ijould have\nto dub copies of all the programs you wish to have for the Repository, Now, to\ncover this cost we must charge our going rat® which is £5,00 per reel. At that\nrate the following series would cost you approximately £430.00:\n- 26 reels\n• 7 reels\n- 7 reels\n- 7 reels\n- 13 reels\nRoots of Jazz\nKnow Your Neighbors - 7 reels\nWhat’s the Big Idea? - 7 reels\nWorld of Wonders - 7 reels\nSurvey of the ladrigal - 13 reels\nfen's Right to Knowledge - 26 reels\nThus, I think it would be best if you consulted the individual producers to see\nif they can be of assistance to you,\nWAYS OF MANKIND and JEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE are, as you may know, LP altos, although\nwe do have them on tape at a higher price, We cannot rent these albums as only\nthe Audio-Visual Aids Department of the University of Illinois has that power\nwhich was given thorn by us as part of an agreement we made some time ago. If you\nwish to rent them from A-V here, fine; but we were wondering if DAVI might not\nwish to buy them from us at 125.00 per album.\nI am sorry about this, but our policies are fast and hard on these matters, and\nI don’t see how w© can sidestep them.\nBest wishes.\nREUidfc\noe* T ** *****\nRobert E. Underwood, Jr,\nNetwork fenager"
