Brooker\nExecutive Secretary\nnational Education Association\n1201 Sixteenth Street, N.W.\nWashington 6, D. 0.\nDear Floyde:\n11 r* r relying to your letter or April 6, addressed to Dr.\nHarr; iX. Skornla, Executive Director of NAEB.\nIfm delighted to know that there is the possibility of NEA\nadding a'professional specialist to its staff to provide\nleadership in the general area of the classroom planning,\nproduction, and utilization of television for education, as\nwell as to work with DA1/!, and other sections of NEA. There\nis no value in television per se. What television can do\nfor education Is only what educators themselves do in\nutilizing the medium. It*0 potential is great, but much\nneeds to be done to study and evaluate hov TV can best serve\nin the educational process.\nSincerely yours,\nFES:cJf\n* Sko r ni a\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident"
