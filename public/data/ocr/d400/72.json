The EastemEducational Network runs from Washington\nto Boston, and ties in with state networks in Maine, New Hampshire,\nVermont and New York. With the assistance of NET, EEN is providing\na full-scale demonstration of what interconnection can mean\" to\neducational broadcasting, on a regional level. NET and PBL\nhave provided interconnection nationwide, giving dramatic evidence\nof how networking can benefit ETV stations, and their audiences,\nsimultaneously. Occasionally, there have been interconnections with\nprogram resources outside the United States.\nMore than half of the operating ETV stations are now interÂ¬\nconnected with at least one other station, via intra- and inter-state\nland-line systems, and. several off-air pickups. These linkages only\nserve local needs, but are the building blocks for state, regional\nand national networks as well. About half of the interconnected\nstations are linked by leased lines; and the rest are connected\nby facilities owned by the ETV licensees.\nDespite the progress thath has been made, it is abundantly\nclear that all of the stations want and need greatly expanded\ninterconnection for educational broadcasting. As program staffs\nand budgets increase, the stations are better able to get out into\ntheir communities and regions to tap remote program resources.\nIndividual communities have moie and better programming to exchange\namong themselves. The demand for intra-state networking is\naccerlerating. Several state networks are already in operation.\nConstruction of several more (in Kentucky, Tennessee, and South\nDakota, for example) is nearing completion. And still more states"
