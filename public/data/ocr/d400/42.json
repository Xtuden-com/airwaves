Holt Riddleberger\nAttached is a copy of the Federal Communications Commission\nNotice of Proposed Rule Making in the matter of free or reduced rate\ninterconnection services for noncommercial educational broadcasting.\nThis notice is primarily directed toward inviting comments on specific\nproposals for reporting by common carriers of requests for, and\nrefusals of, rate reducations to educational broadcasters.\nHowever, the notice gives educational broadcasters their first\nopportunity to place on the public record their comments on the whole\nrange of past problems with respect to interconnection via common\ncarrier, as well as the opportunities for service which free or reduced\nrates would make possible.\nNAEB will be filing such a document, as will a number of national,\nregional and state networks and organizations, and some individual stations.\nIf you are one of those planning to file comments directly with the FCC,\nwe would like to be sent a copy of your filing. If you are not planning to\nfile formally, we'd appreciate any \"case histories\" or comments you\nmight wish to make on the basis of your experience in dealing with common\ncarriers on a local, state, regional or other basis.\nThe filing date is very close at hand: October 16th. We would\nneed your informal comments as soon as possible -- certainly not later\nthan October 8th - -so that we could incorporate them in our own comments.\nWe think this is a matter of vital importance to the future of educaÂ¬\ntional broadcasting, and appreciate your help in documenting the record."
