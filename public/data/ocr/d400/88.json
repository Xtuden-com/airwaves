C. 20006\nApril 12, 1968\nAREA CODE 202\nTELEPHONE\n337-6313\nMr. James Fellows\nThe National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Jim:\nThe Commission’s staff in the Rules and Standards\nDivision has clarified the Commission’s \"one-station, one-\nmarket\" rule making proposal. That proposal is not intended\nto affect the standing exemption of educational broadcasters\nfrom the multiple ownership rules.\nHowever, the draftmanship of the proposed rules\nhas created confusion. For instance, Section 73.636 now\nprovides in sub-paragraph (a) that licenses will not be\ngranted (1) if there is a prohibited overlap with a commonly-\ncontrolled station, or (2) if there is undue concentration of\ncontrol. Sub-paragraph (b) provides that sub-paragraph (a)\n\"is not applicable to non-commercial educational stations\".\nThe Commission intended to add a sub-paragraph (3) to (a)\nabove, but instead proposed a new sub-paragraph (c). As such,\nit is possible to read the Commission’s proposal as including\neducational stations, since sub-paragraph (b), the exemption\nprovision, refers only to sub-paragraph (a).\nAccordingly, NAEB should file a brief clarifying\nstatement on June 26, 1968, when comments are now due, confirm¬\ning that the new policies are not applicable to educational\nstations. Moreover, since only the FM and TV rules now contain\nan explicit exemption clause, it would be wise to request the\nCommission also to clarify that the exemption policy also\napplies to the AM rules. We will include such a request in the\ncomments we file.\nSincerely yours,\nRobert A. Woods"
