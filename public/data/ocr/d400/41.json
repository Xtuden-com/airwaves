C. 20054\nRe: 47 CFR Part 43\nDocket #18316\nFCC 68 - 909\nDear Mr. Waple:\nThe Eastern Educational Radio Network, Inc. supports the proposed rules\nestablishing authorization for a free or reduced rate for interconnec¬\ntion of non-commercial educational television and radio services.\nIn reaching a favorable decision on the proposed rule, the Federal\nCommunications Commission will open new opportunities for the exchange\nof educational programs among non-commercial stations. Being one of\nthe major groups operating an interconnected educational radio network\nin the past, I can tell you that the monthly line charges cut deeply into\npotential programming dollars. Although the carriers were sympathetic\nto the problems of line overhead costs, they felt unable to reduce or\neliminate charges even for the most worthwhile programs.\nOne of the major stumbling blocks in the way of significant new network\nbroadcasting efforts among educational stations appears to be the inter¬\nconnection cost. The EERN urges approval of the proposed rule change.\nSincerely,\n(£-——\nRoger^jenn, Ph.D.\nDirector of Broadcasting\nRP:ah President, EERN, Inc.\ncc: EERN Directors\nMr. Mott, NER"
