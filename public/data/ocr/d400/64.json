C.\nDear Commissioner Johnson:\nThank you for inviting me to the radio programming\nluncheon August 8 at The Brookings Institution.\nAs a newcomer to the area it provided me with an\nopportunity to meet you and others with whom I’ll\nbe working.\nI found the discussion stimulating and productive.\nIt was my feeling that the conversation was so un¬\nstructured that it was impossible to draw any precise\nconclusions. However, it is my feeling that the\nprogramming of educational radio stations is limited\nby these factors: (1) a lack of creative production\nand program personnel, (2) insufficient funds to employ such\npersonnel if they were available in quantity, and (3) a\nvagueness of purpose and indecisiveness regarding programming\nrelating to social issues.\nThese are generalizations and do not apply to all\nstations. There are other factors. In the main, these\nare matters that impact educational radio station program¬\nming.\nI hope there will be future opportunities to discuss\nthis matter.\nAgain, I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you.\nSincerely,\nRAM: Ikl\ncc: William G. Harley\nRobert A. Mott"
