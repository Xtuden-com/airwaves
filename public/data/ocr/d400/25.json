W.\nWashington, D C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nTV Diciest circulated an FCC organization chart ^\nrecently^in which the position of Chief, Research\nand Education Division was shown to be vacant.\nAlthough I was aware that your position is that of\nChief, Educational Broadcasting Branch, the chart\nshowing the vacancy in research and education is\ncreating confusion.\nI received two calls asking about your status and\nwhether or not you were still the liaison for edu-\ncational stations*\nIt*s unfortunate that the division vaaancy exists\nas there is now a marked increase in educational\nradio broadcasting activity. In addition, many\neducational broadcasters will believe â€” af\ning at the chart -- that you are no longer with the\nFCC. The result wTll be a slowdown in communication\nbetween the Commission and the educational stations.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:lkl"
