C. 20036\nOFFICE\nOF THE PRESIDENT\nMEMORANDUM\nTo: Mr. Sandler\nJune 25, 1967\nBob Woods and I have reviewed in considerable detail the\nFairleigh Dickinson University / New York University\napplications for FM frequencies. His recommendation is\nthat the Association not file in this matter for the\nfollowing reasons:\n1) Any position we might take on these issues would\ninevitably place us in support of or in opposition to one\nor the other of the applicants. This is inconsistent with\nour carefully followed procedures that have guarded against\ntaking sides in comparative and competitive hearings.\n2) We have doubtful standing in the case. Since\nNAEB is not an applicant we would have to establish stand¬\ning in the hearing and this might involve our taking sides\nin the matter.\n3) The present hearing is not the best place for us\nto review the basic issues in the proceeding. To the\nextent that we wish to address ourselves to this matter\nit might be appropriate to seek special rule-making deal¬\ning with issues in comparative applications for educa¬\ntional stations. This is a substantial step which requires\nfull staff discussion and possibly even Board concurrance.\nSuch a rule-making equest would also require an analysis\nof the positive criteria which the Commission should employ\nin such contests between educational applicants.\nJF\nJAF:smg"
