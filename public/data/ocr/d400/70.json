We were\nencouraged when the Congress enacted Section 396(h). And we are\nencouraged now that you, Mr. Chairman, have convened this group to\nbegin the work toward that end.\n1. In discussing our position, we acknowledge the special\nemphasis on national interconnection, given by others here. We\nsupport their positions.- With the support of the Ford Foundation,\nNational Educational Television has made great strides forward in\ndemonstrating the potential of national network services. We would\nspeak here from the viewpoint of the stations and their own inter¬\nconnection needs and accomplishments, which are partly distinct local,\nstate and regional needs, but which are also a vital part of the\nnational network services described by the others here.\nInterconnection is almost always mentioned together with\ngreater programming resources as one of the two great needs of\neducational broadcasting stations. This is not surprising,\nbecause in fact interconnection enables us to use our program\nresources more widely, and more wisely. (3) Our concern is not\nwith budget-cutting, but with more concentrated application of those\nlimited resources to the end-product of our activities--our program\nservice—rather than to the mechanics of that service."
