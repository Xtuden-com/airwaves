According to the FCC's\nlatest annual report, plans for 39 state networks are on file.\nAt the regional level, the Western Educational Network, the\nRocky Mountain Network, the Central Educational Network, and the\nSouthern Educational Communications Association hope to develop\nregional interconnections, and Midwest Educational Television plans\nto expand its present system. The EEN plans to continue and extend\nits present demonstration system on a permanent basis.\nTitle I of the Public Broadcasting Act removes the former 15%\nlimitation on amounts available to assist in financing the\nconstruction of interconnection facilities. But because of the\ncontinuing basic need for new stations, and the delay in the\nappropriation, the development of additional privately owned\nsystems by this route still seems far away. Moreover, given the\ncommon carriers' present tariffs, we can expect that expansion of\nstate and regional systems via leased linesâ€”especially in areas\nwhere distances between population centers are great--is probably\nequally remote.\nAt the national level, NET at present tariffs is able to\ninterconnect its affiliated stations regularly for only a few hours\nperweek, for only a portion of the year; and for occasional special\nprogramming. Educational television stations should have a national\ninterconnection capability available, for purposes of networking and\nprogram distribution. That end can probably be achieved in direct\nproportion to the extent that interconnection becomes available to ETV\nat free or reduced rates."
