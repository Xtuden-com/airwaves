Harley\nBob Hilliard called (October 18, 1968) to say that there is\na case over at the FCC which may be of interest to us and\nwill bear watching.\nWBAI, New York City's Pacifica station, has been charged by\nthe Commission with violation of performance rules, because\nthe FCC has lumped it with commercial stations and applied\nthe criteria of performance for commercial stations against\nWBAI. WBAI has a non-commercial educational license but is\noperating on an unreserved channel; the Commission has taken\nto classifying all stations operating on unreserved channels\nas being a part of the commercial part of the industry. WBAI\nhas protested and pointed out the many rules which do not apply.\nThis controversy has obvious implications to educational\nbroadcasting, because all of our AM radio stations occupy\nunreserved channels and it took us years to get special\nforms developed for educational stations. I don't think\nthere is anything we can do directly in this matter in terms\nof a formal filing, but we should watch it.\n- WGH\nWGH/hc"
