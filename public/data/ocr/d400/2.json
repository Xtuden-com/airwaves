  "text": "-3-\nWe have been under considerable pressure primarily from AMST to file\nadditional comments on the subject of land mobile radio proceedings. AMST\nin the person of Les Lindow feels very strongly that the FCC is likely to come\nout with a ruling in the near future which would in effect permit at least exÂ¬\nperimentally some sharing of Channels 14-20. We have sent marked copies of\nour original filing in this matter to a number of the Commissioners, but we\nhave on advice of Counsel made no direct contact with the Commissioners.\nAlthough this is not an adjudicatory proceeding, there is some concern about\nex-parte pleadings in so controversial rulemaking as this one. It seems we\nwill therefore have to sit and wait along with the rest of the industry for an\nFCC determination."
