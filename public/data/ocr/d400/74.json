The greatest\nimpediment to the development of state and regional radio networks\nhas been the cost factor. State and regional radio networking is\nvirtually nonexistent, and there has been only one nationally interÂ¬\nconnected program in recent years. A little help here could go a\nvery long way; we hope there may be an opportunity for Mr. Sandler\nExecutive Director of National Educational Radio, to speak to this\npoint later.\nResponsiveness to diverse community, state, regional and\nnational needs is the hallmark of educational broadcasting. But\ndiversity in isolation is little more than a euphemism for provincialism.\nIn direct proportion to the degree that the cost of interconnection is\nreduces, we will be able\n(1) to concentrate educational broadcasters' scarce resources\nupon the production of more and better programs, and\n(2) to make the programming and distributive benefits of\ninterconnection more widely attainable.\nWe stand ready to help in any way we can in the implementation\nof this policy.\n4"
