W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Mr. Sandler:\nI am enclosing a copy of the letter I wrote to Bill Harley\non April 22 regarding the situation in Miami, Florida as regards\neducational FM channel use where Channel 6 TV stations are on\nthe air.\nMy telephone conversation with you today answered my\nletter to Bill namely that someone has to build a fire under the\nFCC to get them to move.\nOur client plans to submit an application to the FCC for a\n100 kw ERP FM station in Miami. I understand there are other\neducational FM applications reposing at the FCC with no action\nbeing taken until the educational FM allocations table is set up.\nThis may never happen but perhaps adding another application\nmay help break the jam.\nCecil S. Bidlack\nCSB:ljs\nend: 4-22-68 letter\ncc: Dr. Poland"
