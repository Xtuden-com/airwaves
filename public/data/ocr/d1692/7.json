Requests for copies\nran to some two hundred and we were asked to continue by all means,\nand try to devise methods of getting more information on the\nqualitative reactions of listeners, since existing surveys already\nprovide an abundance of information on radios turned on. We have\ntried, in a small way, to meet the need expressed. This survey thereÂ¬\nfore considers that part of its findings which pertain to radios on\nand off, and what people are listening to at specific periods, as\nincidental only. It is our hope that by this survey at least some\nideas for new techniques may be generated and that in it may be found\nsome facts, not available elsewhere, which may be of some value to\nbroadcasters.\nFindings have been placed in tables which, as far as possible,\nspeak for themselves. The observations we make at the end of this\nsurvey are personal observations only, based on some two months of\nworking with and compiling results."
