Revenue from the re¬\ncording service is applied to the operation of WTTW.\n*****\nA new line of closed circuit vidicon television\nequipment has just been announced by the General\nPrecision Laboratory, Inc., Pleasantville, N. Y. The\nmodel PD-250 camera incorporates a five-inch elec¬\ntronic viewfinder, a four-lens turret and either port¬\nable or rack-mounted control equipment. For studio\ninstallations a control console is available, equipped\nwith a 14-inch picture monitor, a five-inch waveform\nmonitor and rack mounted control unit with remote\ncontrol panel. The PD-250 camera is priced at $1,750\nand operates from an external RETMA sync or an in¬\nternal sync generator. Where budget requirements\nare restrictive, the model PD-250 camera priced at\n$1,250 is self contained and provides either video or\nRF output. It is equipped with a three lens turret\nas standard equipment but has no viewfinder.\n*****\nGlen Southworth, chief engineer of KWSC, the\nState College of Washington at Pullman, is the author\nof an article on page 100 of the February 14 elec¬\ntronics. The article outlines a method of determining\noptimum electronic focus of television cameras and\nfilm chains by a special bar chart and by adjusting\nfocus controls for maximum response of peaks on the\nwaveform monitor. This chart, developed by Mr.\nSouthworth, also permits rapid determination of the\nsystem resolution and relative resolving power of dif¬\nferent camera lenses.\n*****\nFebruary 1958 Electronic Industries contains a re¬\nport on progress achieved by the EIA Committee,\nMicrowave Relay Systems for Communication (TR-\n14) on “Standardizing Microwave Communication\nSystems.” Due to the many and varied uses of micro-\nwave systems, it has been found necessary to stand¬\nardize the various units and to arrive at a glossary of\nterms to best describe the microwave communication\nprocess. By reference to these standards it may be\npossible for buyers to simplify the specification of\ncomplete systems. The article was written by Tre¬\nvor Clarke, former chairman of the above committee.\n*****\nWRFK-FM at the Union Theological Seminary,\nRichmond 27, Va. is increasing power to one kilowatt.\nThey wish to purchase used frequency and modula¬\ntion monitors for this transmitter.

The FM antenna is a gift to the state of\nWisconsin Valley Television, Inc. and is being in¬\nstalled at about the 500-foot level on the tower. The\nadded antenna height is expected to extend the\nWHRM secondary coverage by 15 miles and add per¬\nhaps 25 per cent to the area served with a satisfac¬\ntory FM signal, acording to Jack Stiehl, chief en¬\ngineer of the Wisconsin State Broadcasting Service.\nIt is also expected that shadow areas or dead spots\nwithin the present coverage contours will be elimi¬\nnated.\nETV STATIONS ON THE AIR\nKCTS\nSeattle, Wash.\n9\nKETA\nOkla.
