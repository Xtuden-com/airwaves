However, the officers\nof the Association have waged many \"battles\" that are known only to them - affairs\naffecting educational broadcasting in many ways*\nFederal Trade Commission Asks For Suggestions\nLate in May all stations received the following letter from the Federal Trade\nCommission:\n\"This Commission has directed that hereafter more attention shall be gqven to\nthe subject of commercial representations by radio broadcast* This is in response\nto a general demand that the same rules for advertising be observed in radio broad¬\ncasts as those enforced by the Commission with respect to periodical advertising*\n\"It is anticipated that the radio industry will display the same cooperative\nspirit as the publishing industry has, to the end that unfair, false and misleading\nadvertising shall be eliminated from interstate commerce*\n’’Commencing July 1, 1934, and until further notice, you are respectfully re¬\nquested to procure copies of all commercial continuities (other than network pro¬\ngrams and electrical transcriptions) issued through your facilities, and forward\nthese, with dates of broadcasts and addresses of advertisers, to the Special Board of\nInvestigation, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D* C*\n\"For convenience these may be mailed once a week, to be filed and reviewed by\nthe Board*\n\"Government franks are enclosed for your use in transmitting such copies*\nAdditional franks will be supplied as needed*"
