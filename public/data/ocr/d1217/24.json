Durr has made a record of serving the people’s interests as a member of\nthe Federal Communication© Ccr mission.\nDurr’s term of office is due to expire June 30, and the President has not yet sent his\nname to the senate for reappointment.\nIf Durr is not reappointed, radio in general and educational and rural radio in particular\nwill suffer a loss from which it may never recover.\nEnclosed are three statements about Durr: (1) a copy of an editorial from the CO¬\nOPERATIVE CONSUMER, (2) an excerpt from an article in the same publication, (3) a copy\nof a statement from the trade magazine, VARIETY.\nEnclosed also is a list of present members of the FCC and members of the Interstate\nCommerce Committee, parent committee of the Federal Communications Commission.\nN-A-E-B members have already received a copy of a telegram sent to President Truman\nrequesting Durr’s reappointment.\nIf you have a deep and sincere interest in educational radio and a concern with a\nfree and unmonopolized radio, it is earnestly suggested you convey your feeling about\nDurr to members of the Commerce Committee, your elected representatives, and any other\navenues which may occur to you.\nIt does not seem to us this is in any way a party matter. Your concern should be\nvoiced in terms of your own situation and in terms of your feeling for educational\nbroadcasting in the United States."
