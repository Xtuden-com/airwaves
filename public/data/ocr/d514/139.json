This will be our first opportunity to discuss NAEB PR\nproblems and for some of us, our first fact-to-face meeting. I*m looking\nforward to a constructive exchange of ideas which will result in some\nconcrete recommendations to the NAEB Board. Exact room for our meeting\nhas not yet been designated; check at the NAEB registration desk for\ninformation on the twenty-first.\nIn the meantime, recommendations for NAEB Public Relations which\ncame out of the Airlie House Seminar held this summer in Warrenton,\nVirginia, included an assignment for our Committee which should be in\nthe mail early in October. It is the preparation of a one-page sheet\nsuitable for mailing to selected newspapers throughout the United\nStates listing items describing the nature and services of the NAEB\nwhich would be suitable for \"filler” material. Would you please\nlist several brief items which you feel would make good filler mater¬\nial and. thus help to spread the good word about our organization?\nDeadline is September 28.\nI»ll look forward to seeing you all on the twenty-first.\nMeantime,\nAll the best.\nMarion Corwell, Chairman\nNAEB Public Relations Committee\ncc: Harold Hill\nBetty McKenzie"
