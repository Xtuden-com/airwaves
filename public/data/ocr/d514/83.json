We hope that\nour Industrial Associates will take advantage of this opportunity\nto distribute informational (non-promotional) pamphlets, reprints,\nbooks, etc., to educational broadcasters.\nIn our first mailing on May 8, we had two items from RCA and a reprint\nfrom Adler. At present I have on hand two items from Ampex, and a\nbooklet from Sarkes Tarsian on \"The Care and Feeding of Tape Recorders.\nAfter looking at your handsome book on Teaching with Videotape, we\nthought this sounded like an excellent piece for us to distribute to\nNASB members for 3M. If you can provide us with 1200 copies, we will\nbe happy to mall them to all our members. If the booklets are not\navailable in that quantity, we could use 350 which we would mail to\nour Actives and Aasociates.\nPlease send to me, at 53 Bast Armory, Champaign, Illinois.\nSineertly,\n(Mrs.) Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMC/dp\nblcc: Mr. Harold E. Hill"
