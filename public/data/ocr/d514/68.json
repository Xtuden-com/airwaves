Examine the public relations recommendations of the 1961 NAEB seminar and\nimplement those which are practical and feasible.\n2. Provide newspapers with \"filler” materials describing the nature and services\nof the NAEB.\n3 . Supply printed public relations material to be made available to station managers\nand others who have need for such material. Present descriptive folders of this nature\nshould be updated and made more attractive.\n4. Prepare an identification slide for member TV stations with accompanying copy\nfor use on station breaks; provide appropriate radio copy of a similar nature.\n5. Prepare a one-paragraph description of the NAEB to be used at the end of all\nreleases by member stations, both nationally and locally. This should be related to\nstation promotion stories dealing with forthcoming NAEB programs, announcements of\nNAEB committee assignments, etc.\nBecause it is impossible, for the NAEB president to issue individual letters to all\ncommittee appointees, it was recommended that an open letter to committee appointees\nbe printed in the NAEB NEWSLETTER, emphasizing the importance of the committee\nappointment and charging the appointees to assume the responsibility vested in them,\nr It was recommended that a Publicity Committee be formed, with the chairman serving\nas vice chairman of the Public Relations Committee, and vice versa. This arrangement\nwould serve as a cohesive force in the functioning of these committees; the added\nmanpower would make it possible for assignments to be carried out which have here¬\ntofore been impossible."
