I'm afraid the old ones have all been\nrun and cut and some of them stuffed into the\nfoldersâ€”a job I don't care to repeat for some\ntime! However, I'm putting these in a folder\nwhich I'll refer to when, as, and if we update\nthe Portfolio...or run out of mimeo'd sheets of\nthe old ones, etc.\nI also got the enclosed yesterday. I thought\nyou'd enjoy same.\nShe, too, sent along some materials that would\nhave been quite helpful had we had them earlier.\nBest\nHappy Thanksgiving..."
