One company\nwill not take ads announcing dates\nfor an event, inasmuch as it cannot\nguarantee to find vacant space at the\nappropriate time.\nIn general, however, there is no\nrestriction on the content of adver¬\ntising, within the bounds of simple\ngood taste. Nor is there a limit, ex¬\ncept in a few cities, on the number\nof times a group may approach the\nadvertising company for space.\nCompanies that do not offer free\nspace, but that do offer reduced rates,\ngenerally charge between 20 per cent\nand 50 per cent of the standard price.\nSome charge a flat labor fee of 20\ncents or 25 cents per card placed.\nIn all but one case, the institution\nis responsible for the preparation of\nits own posters. Costs for these vary\nwidely, depending upon the materials\nused, the number of colors printed,\nand the number of cards required.\nRequests for free or cut-rate adver¬\ntising space should, in general, be\naddressed to the head of a transit\nadvertising company in your commu¬\nnity. Many of these companies are\nlinked through ownership or asso¬\nciation into regional or national net¬\nworks. These make it possible for\nnational cultural organizations, as\ndistinct from local institutions, to\nplace a message in busses, streetcars\nand subways in dozens of cities at\none time—at little or no cost.\n25 Selected Cities\nCode: A—free space available; B—space\nat reduced rates available; C—no special\naccommodation for arts groups.\nATLANTA B\nBALTIMORE B\nBOSTON .

A\nAM BRIBES\nON TARGET\nAnnie Oakleys?\nPress passes are no guarantee of publicity.\nUnless judiciously distributed they can\nmean only empty seats, lost revenue and\nnothing in the paper the morning after.\nTry sending coupons instead of tickets,\nwith the stipulation that the reporter or\neditor pick up and sign for the tickets at\nthe box office before a specified hour. This\nguards against empty seats and lost income,\nand discourages the editor from giving the\npasses to a non-journalistic friend. The\nsigned coupons also give you a list of\nwriters who did attend.\nOut of volunteers?\nIf you need clerical help in an emergency\nand have exhausted sources of volunteer\naid, you can hire trained office personnel\non a day-to-day and even an hour-to-hour\nbasis. Temporary help services are avail¬\nable in most cities. Hourly rates are modest.\nOften you can hire highly skilled tempo¬\nrary workers to set up offices, conduct sur¬\nveys, staff conventions, solicit contributions\nand even conduct research.\nCalendar deadline\nFrom Copenhagen to Kyoto, the United\nStates Information Agency distributes,\namong other things, a Summer Music Cal¬\nendar of the United States. Intended to help\npromote tourism, and to tell others about\ncultural life in the U.S., the calendar is\npublished by the President’s Music Com¬\nmittee of the People-to-People Program. It\nis also used by the travel industry. March\n31 is the deadline for musical organizations\nto submit their summer programs for inclu¬\nsion in the 1962 summer calendar. Listings,\nincluding date, place, hour and program\ndetails, should be addressed to: The Presi¬\ndent’s Music Committee, 734 Jackson Place,\nN.W., Washington 6, D.C.\nFilling the board room\nPlanning to ask a prominent person to\nserve on your board? Direct personal con¬\ntact is, of course, far more effective than\nletters or phone calls. Will a board mem¬\nber who knows him pave the way? When\nyou see him, be prepared to specify the\nlength of the term he is expected to fill,\nthe frequency of meetings, names of others\non the board, and details of your program,\nincluding finances. In the event he turns\nyou down, on the spot or later by mail,\nnote down his reasons. You may want to\nbear them in mind when you see him again\n—or another prospect.\nAfter the thank-you\nFund raising public relations must not\nend when the drive is over. Contributors\nlike to know what is being done with their\ngifts. Keep them informed to keep interest\nhigh until the next campaign.\nUNIONS BACK CULTURE...\n(continued from page one)\nin the future that appeal to us as opportuni¬\nties for public service, I am sure that our\nlocals and our divisional offices will do what\nwe did here.” The union now has 400 locals\nand regional offices in the United States\nand Canada.\nOther unions have also given aid. The\nAmerican Federation of Musicians local in\nDetroit makes a regular, substantial con¬\ntribution to the Detroit Symphony. In Port¬\nland, Oreg. more than 200 A.F.L.-C.I.O.\nbricklayers and 60 hod carriers put up the\nwalls of the Oregon Museum of Science\nand Industry in one day. The value of their\nvolunteer labor was estimated at $50,000.\nOther unions pitched in to make the build¬\ning-bee a success.\nIf you decide to seek labor support, try\ntalking first with officials of such culture-\nconscious unions as the Musicians, Teachers\nor the Newspaper Guild. If they are not\nable to help directly, they may steer you\nto other unions who can, and advance your\ncause in your city-wide Central Labor\nUnion.\nCHECKLIST\nA selective monthly memo on\nrelevant reading—including a few\ntitles from places not on the\nbeaten cultural path.
