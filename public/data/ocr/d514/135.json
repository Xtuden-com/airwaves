Corwell\nManager, Educational TV\nHenry Ford Museum\nGreenfield Village\nDearborn, Michigan\nDear Marion:\nYour letter and the speeches for the Speaker's Portfolio arrived yest¬\nerday safely,. .which I wanted to let you know, though I haven't yet had\ntime to go over it carefully.\nRight now, it looks as though I will not have an opportunity to get the\nstuff finished before the convention. However, I'm hoping to get the\ncovers printed before then...and we can announce the fact that the insides\nare in preparation and that they should be on the lookout for them shortly.\n1 11 take a couple of covers along so we can show them what they look like.\nThis shouldn t hurt anything too much, since we didn't plan to actually\ndistribute them at the convention anyway.\nHarold called the other day about this, and a summary of our conversation\nis that we 11 have covers printed for each. We'll send one free copy to\nm®mberi fol extras they'll have to pay 2^ each. This\nis too bad--that we have to charge, in a way—but the economic facts of life\nare that this is the only way we can possibly hope to recover all costs\nexcept the $100 the Board authorized us to spend.\ntod thanks for the copy of your announcement of your committee meeting on\nSunday evening. I do hope to attend, unless something occurs to prevent it.\noee you then.\nCordially,\n(Mrs.) Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMCK/mp\ncc: Mr. Harold E. Hill\nOffices at 59 East Armory, Champaign, Illinois"
