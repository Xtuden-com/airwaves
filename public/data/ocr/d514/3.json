This committee\nadvises the President and Editor on all such matters and is expected\nto recommend activities ranging from day-to-day ’’publicity” to long-\nrange promotional goals.”\nAs you know, this committee has always worked closely with Betty\nMcKenzie on PR activities. I know she would appreciate your help on\nday-to-day publicity-type operations, and we would all appreciate your\ncommittee looking into the matter of long-range promotion and publicity\nin an effort to establish a better national ’’image” of the NJiEB and\neducational broadcasting in general."
