I really did. Your letter has been\non my desk ever since it arrived. It would get buried now and then,\nbut I would dig it out and stare at the second paragraph of Mr, Hodupp's\nletter to Bill Harley.\nNormally this sort of thing comes easily to me, and it was frustrating\nto reach for an idea and have nothing there. I decided that the trouble\nlay in the fact that I have never seen \"Family Living\" with or without\nArlene Francis. But that's a pretty flimsy excuse. Any organization\nwhich performs a genuine service to the public ought to be able to tell\nabout that service regardless of the setting.\nI've thought about it off and on all day, and I think maybe I have an\nanswer. NAEB is perhaps more of a profession, or^an-f y.aMnn than a ser¬\nvice outfit. It performs services, certainly, but these usually affect\ntHe\"~p‘uFlic through th^IocaT educationa 1 stations.\nThe yellow and black brochure has much good information. It tells\nabout the history of NAEB, its membership, defines its role as a pro¬\nfessional association and as a trade association, tells where its\nsupport comes from, mentions research which it supports, describes its\ninternational activities and some of its unique qualities, gives some\ninformation about the radio network. But this is a collection of fair\nmiscellaneous information. The brochure contains no compelling state¬\nment of purpose.\nI was on the NAEB board during the hassel with the Center — which may\nstill be going on for all I know. One of the basic causes of trouble,"
