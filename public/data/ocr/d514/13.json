  "text": "New Arts Council Plans To Aid Individuals And\nBold Experiments As National Movement Grows\nA New Profession...\nWithin the crowded, changing cul¬\ntural scene today a subtle develop¬\nment is taking place—the growth of\na new profession.\nThere has always been a place for\nthe competent “arts manager.” Today,\nas cultural enterprises proliferate, the\ntechnical standards demanded of their\nmanagers are rising. What is happen¬\ning is the professionalization of arts\nmanagement.\nIt may, on the surface, seem odd\nto lump under the single term “arts\nmanager” the producer of a theatre\ncompany, the director of a museum,\nthe manager of a symphony orchestra,\nand many others, both staff and vol¬\nunteer. Yet it requires little more than\na second glance to show that all of\nthem face many problems in common.\nFinances, for example, plague them\nall. Ways of reaching the audience,\nbuilding attendance or participation,\nand explaining purpose must he\nmastered by all of them.\nOn this level there is an important\nbond among them, and many of the\ntechniques used in one field are trans¬\nferable to another. Arts Management's\nfocus is entirely on this level. It con¬\ncerns itself with improving the meth¬\nods used by arts managers and adding\nnew techniques and ideas to their\nrepertoire.\nThis is not because AM's editors\nbelieve the arts should be run like a\nbusiness. But there is a difference\nbetween running a cultural enterprise\nlike a business and running it in a\nbusiness-like fashion. We think that\nrunning cultural undertakings in a\nbusiness-like fashion is vital to their\ncontinued survival today. And we be¬\nlieve that the better they are man¬\naged, the less time and energy will\nhave to be diverted from achieving\nexcellence in art itself to the business\nof keeping body and soul together.\nWith this in mind, we earnestly\ninvite you to help make the pages of\nArts Management a lively forum for\nthe exchange of experiences, advice,\nideas. If you have had success with a\nnovel public relations approach, let\nus know about it so we can pass the\nword along. If you have had trouble\nwith fund raising, budgeting, board¬\nbuilding or some other aspect of your\nmanagement work, and can offer\nothers a bit of cautionary advice,\ndrop us a note about it.\nIn any event, please put us on\nyour mailing list to receive your re¬\nleases, reports, and other printed\nmaterial. We will reciprocate by\nserving the arts management profes¬\nsion as dedicated journalists. We hope\nyou will subscribe, of course.\n—ALVIN TOFFLER\nThe growing movement toward inter-dis¬\nciplinary cooperation in the arts has\ntaken a long stride forward with forma¬\ntion of an arts council in Washington, D.C.\nOrganized with the encouragement of Wil¬\nliam Walton, the painter who is President\nKennedy’s friend and cultural advisor, the\ncouncil makes Washington the nation’s sec¬\nond largest city to boast a working federa¬\ntion of arts groups. New York, with its\nLincoln Center, is the largest. Councils\nalso have been formed in perhaps 100 other\nU.S. and Canadian cities, including Cincin¬\nnati, St. Louis, St. Paul, and Vancouver.\nOrganizing activity is underway in scores\nof additional communities.\nThe council in Washington brings into a\nsingle organization Howard Mitchell, con¬\nductor of the National Symphony Orches¬\ntra, Zelda Fichandler, producing director of\nthe Arena Stage, Monroe Bush of the Old\nDominion Foundation, representatives of the\nWashington Ballet, the Washington opera\nsociety, local museums and other groups.\nThe new council differs from most in\ntwo of its announced objectives. According\nto Paul Callaway, musical director of the\nopera society, and president of the new or¬\nganization, it will “seek financial support\nfor new, artistically rewarding and often\nboldly experimental undertakings” by estab¬\nlished member institutions. Most arts coun¬\ncils that have financial programs limit them¬\nselves to providing maintenance funds for\nmember groups or to building joint facilities.\nThey do not usually create a special fund\nto finance innovational productions.\nLikewise a departure from ordinary arts\ncouncil practice is the Washington group’s\nDial ‘C’ for Culture\nA telephone service, believed to be the\nfirst of its kind, is helping to build at¬\ntendance at cultural events and institutions\nin Tucson, Ariz. The technique, readily\nadaptable for use in other cities, provides\nthe public with a single telephone number\nto use in finding out exactly what cultural\nperformances or exhibitions are scheduled\nthat evening.\nOne call to 327-4909 in Tucson not only\ngives the caller a list of four or five sched¬\nuled events, but also the address, phone\nnumber, time, admission price, if any, and\nbox office location.\nCalled Tucson Tonight, the service was\ninitiated recently by the Tucson Festival\nCommittee to aid non-profit cultural insti¬\ntutions. Every day a message giving the in¬\nformation described above is read into a\nmachine, leased from the telephone com¬\npany that records the message and plays\nit back to callers. During its first month,\nTucson Tonight received 2,300 phone calls.\nMonthly cost of the leased equipment is\n$10.00 to $15.00, depending on location.\nintention of providing direct financial as¬\nsistance to individual artists for “develop¬\nmental projects.”\nArts councils, a post-war phenomenon,\nhave been rapidly multiplying within the\npast few years. Last year New York state\nset up the nation’s first state-sponsored\ncouncil armed with a sizable budget to sup¬\nport the arts.\nNot all arts federations call themselves\narts councils, and not all arts councils are\nalike. They range from the state-backed\nNew York organization and municipally-\nsupported groups in Richmond, Va. and\nWaterloo, la., to wholly private organiza¬\ntions. Some of these are large and well-\nestablished; others hardly more than a pa¬\nper resolution. Some merely bring local\narts groups together to iron out scheduling\nconflicts. Others work on publicity cam¬\npaigns, stage arts festivals, and represent\nthe cultural community in civic affairs. Still\nothers mount joint fund raising drives.\nToday 40 local councils are members of\nCommunity Arts Councils, Inc., a national\ncoordinating body with headquarters at\n300 Maine Street, Quincy, Ill. Led by George\nIrwin, national president, C.A.C.I. issues\norganizing advice and other useful informa¬\ntion to members and those interested in\nstarting councils.\nC.A.C.I. is also sponsoring a three-day\nexploratory Fund Raising Workshop for\nthe Arts at the Wellington Hotel in New\nYork, March 15-17, 1962. The workshop,\nopen to employees of non-profit arts organi¬\nzations, will feature lectures by successful\nfund raisers from a symphony orchestra, a\nmuseum, an arts council, a Community\nChest and other organizations.\nThe need for such a workshop has been\nemphasized by Ralph Burgard, executive\nsecretary of the St. Paul Council of Arts\nand Sciences, who is organizing the sessions.\n“Most of the annual fund raising campaigns\nconducted by symphonies, operas, museums\nand theatres are badly planned and poorly\nexecuted,” Mr. Burgard charges. “Cries of\n‘Save the Symphony,’ ‘Met Cancels Season,’\n‘Museum Faces Financial Crisis’ resound\nthrough the land.”\nIn sharp contrast, Mir. Burgard points out,\n“our local Community Chests, operating\nin the health and welfare fields, have de¬\nveloped skilled fund raising techniques and\na philosophy of fund raising based on years\nof analysis and study.”\nARTS MANAGEMENT, February 1962, No. 1, published\nmonthly at 38 East 57th Street, New York 22, N.
