I am confi¬\ndent that you will make'kn excellent chairman and the productivity\nof the Committee will be increased by about 100 percent during 1962.\nIn accordance with our conversation, I am enclosing a memo¬\nrandum I wrote recently for the benefit of some people who are work¬\ning cm fund raising. This is one of the pieces that you can put\ntogether to form the image of NAEB.\nAs yet, I have not received the material from the Dearborn\nInn, but I expect it will arrive shortly. When it does, I will launch\nan all-out campaign to get the Educational Media Council to pick\nthe site for its next meeting.\nNaturally, you, the Ford Museum and Greenfield Village (in\norder of importance) will constitute the main attractions.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nEnel,\nWGH/vr"
