For a\nbrief descriptiV®. phrase for NAEB, how do you like--\nNAEB REPRESENTS THE 20TH CENTURY BREAKTHROUGH IN LEARNING\n(or u/e C>0u./^ oui‘‘ ' etout's \"**+*-*/ f )\nIt’s a thought,... I*ve also started to define some of the committees\nobjectives but must wait on some of that until I know more about\nthe areas of responsiHI ity of permanent NAEBstaff members.\nAfter receiving your letter (was most happy to find it when\nI went home to lunch) I called the Fairlane Inn and asked if they’d\nsend you info on their accommodations and conference rooms.\nThey, too, have a pool and the arrangements would be comfortable,\nas you know. Surely a hotel in the Detroit area would have space\nif there’s nothing available in Dearborn, Harlan Hous#e is a\ngood possibility. (It has a pool tool)(And with .Allen Harlan’s\ninterest in education he’d probably do most anything to make\nthe EMC happy.)\nI want to begin my TV productions in February so am giving\ntop priority to writing shows. Have written many letters in an\nattempt to get clearance on our theme... Since these will be\nvideo taped and kined it’s more of a problem.\nDon’t worry about the breakfast...I think it’s about time\nI reciprocated—and I w as\\happy to T,hcst.n\nAnn had surgery on her sinuses Friday and now that I’ve\nRecovered from two .days at the hospital (I hated every minute of\nit...That live Is jusl not for me)...I’m going full speed ahead\non IV. Keep me posted 6h your travel plans..."
