To locate the appropriate foun¬\ndation in a field of 13,000, consult the\nFoundation Directory (Russell Sage Foun¬\ndation, $10.00). Also, a visit to one of the\nsix regional depositories of the Foundation\nLibrary Center offers a chance to consult\nconveniently a wide range of relevant lit¬\nerature. Keep an eye peeled for new founda¬\ntions in your field opening for business and\nlooking for their first grantees.\nThe first contact with a foundation may\nbe a sounding-out session in person or a\nvery brief description of the proposed proj¬\nect in a one- or two-page letter. If this\npiques the interest of the foundation, you\nwill be invited to follow up with a full\npresentation. Although requirements of in¬\ndividual foundations vary widely, here are\na few cardinal points no application should\nfail to cover.\n1. The project—its significance, timeli¬\nness and relationship to the foundation’s\nown aims.\n2. Your organization—its qualifications to\ncarry out the proposed project successfully.\n3. Carry-over value—the usefulness of\nyour project results to others in your field.\n4. Plan for inspection and review—the\nfoundation’s opportunity to oversee work in\nprogress and evaluate results.\n5. Need—proof that the foundation’s aid\nis absolutely essential.\nYou should also include such essentials as\na description of the precise nature of your\norganization, its history, legal form, and\ncontrolling body. List names and addresses\nof officers and professional staff. Explain its\nfinancial status and provide a detailed budget\nfor the current year, along with the name\nand address of the auditor and a copy of\nyour federal tax exemption certificate. Offer\nto supply any further information the founda¬\ntion may request.\nYour presentation should take into con¬\nsideration the sensibilities of the foundation\nand of the community. One foundation exec¬\nutive, for example, may be known to court\nprojects that pay off quickly with commu¬\nnity approval, and to shun those whose re¬\nsults are long-range and less obvious. The\nmore you know about your target foundation,\nthe better.\nTo the old claim that “knowing the right\npeople” can be as much help with founda¬\ntions as elsewhere in our society, foundation\npeople offer mixed comment. Jeanne Brewer,\nan expert on foundation relations, writes of\none foundation official who remarked:\n“Acquaintanceship is no substitute for a\nsoundly constructed proposal.” Yet another,\nshe says, put it this way: “Personal connec¬\ntions with us are important. We look for\ngood proposal ideas first, but they’re rare,\nso we give generally where we know the\nman or the institution asking us.”\nCampus Impresario: New\nThe increasingly important role of col¬\nleges and universities in the cultural\nlife of their communities has been widely\npublicized. They have provided jobs and\nincome for resident composers, artists and\nwriters. They have helped create off-campus\ntheatre groups, dance companies and musi¬\ncal ensembles. They have provided facilities\nand personnel for local cultural organiza¬\ntions.\nLess widely recognized is the potent eco¬\nnomic impact they are having. Today the\ncampus has become a primary “market”\nfor culture, and a dynamic financial factor\nin the performing arts. There are approxi¬\nmately 500 colleges and universities that, in\naddition to presenting plays and concerts\nby their own faculty and students, buy the\nservices of professional performing artists\nand companies, and present regular series\nof cultural attractions. They provide an im¬\nportant and lucrative part of the circuit for\nmany touring performers.\nJulius Bloom, president of the Association\nof College and University Concert Mana¬\ngers, estimates that campus spending on\nsuch cultural programs may be running be¬\ntween $20,000,000 and $25,000,000 a year.\nLarge Universities like Michigan State,\nU.C.L.A., and Ohio State boast cultural\nbudgets topping $100,000 per year. They use\nthese to bring in from 25 to 35 major\nevents. At Michigan State, for example,\nSeries A of a two-series program, offers per¬\nformances by the New York City Ballet,\nthe Old Vic, Leontyne Price, Igor Ois-\ntrakh and Van Cliburn, among others.\nSmaller schools, of course, run more mod¬\nest programs. Minimal budgets of $4,000\n‘Cultural Executive' in City Hall\nIn a move that could set a pattern for\nother municipalities, New York is creat¬\ning a city office devoted exclusively to cul¬\ntivating the arts. Robert W. Dowling, busi¬\nnessman and chairman of the American Na¬\ntional Theatre and Academy, has been\nnamed the city’s first “Cultural Executive”\nand handed the job of shaping a program\nfor the new office.\nMr. Dowling told Arts Management that\nthe idea for the office grew out of official\nconcern over the lack of adequate contact\nbetween the city’s numerous departments\nand the city’s cultural managers. An arts\ngroup seeking to stage a show or exhibit\non city property often has had to bounce\nback and forth between three or four differ¬\nent offices to get the appropriate permits.\nMr. Dowling says his new office will provide\none-stop service for such organizations.\nWhile staff has not yet been selected and\nfull operations are still several months away,\nMr. Dowling says that he and city officials\nare thinking of making a complete inventory\nof all cultural activities in New York.\nForce on Cultural Scene\nor $5,000 are spread over only five to ten\nevents. Usually at least one of these features\na “name” performer.\nIn many colleges, especially the larger\nones, cultural programming is financed\nthrough box-office receipts. At small colleges,\nhowever, students often pay an activities\nfee, part of which goes to support the\ncultural program. Only in scattered instances\ndo colleges subsidize their programs out\nof regular funds.\nThe growth of college cultural program¬\nming has not only changed the shape of\nthe “culture market,” it has also given birth\nto a new campus occupation—that of cul¬\ntural manager or, as it is more frequently\ntermed, college concert manager. In smaller\nschools where the budget is limited, the job\nof administering the cultural program is\ngiven to the head of the drama, speech\nor music department or someone else who\nruns it while handling his ordinary duties\nand receives no extra compensation.\nAt the major schools, however, programs\nhave become so extensive that they require\nfull-time servicing by a trained arts man¬\nager who may get up to $15,000 in salary.\nAs campus cultural programming budgets\nhave risen, administering them has become\nincreasingly complex. To help train people\nto cope with the job, Mr. Bloom’s associa¬\ntion provides advice to hundreds of colleges\non contract negotiation, public relations,\nand budgeting, as well as on the availability\nof attractions. The association, formed five\nyears ago with a handful of members, today\nhas 141 active members, and its regional\nand national meetings are attended by many\nnon-member managers, too.\nProvides One-Stop Service\nThe office, serving as a center for the\nexchange of information, may also offer\ncultural groups direct advice on methods\nof organization, fund raising, and similar\ntechnical matters. There are no plans for\ngoing beyond this to providing funds or\nsubsidies to cultural organizations or to co¬\nordinating the city’s king-sized cultural\nbudget. New York allocates well over $5,-\n000,000 a year to help support museums,\ntheatre, its good music radio station, and\nother cultural activities, not including art\nand music instruction in its schools.\nMaking a Date with the Donor\nA New England school for the deaf has\nused an unusual and effective fund-raising\nreminder that places its appeal before poten¬\ntial givers 12 times annually. Every year it\nsends out a calendar, with each month printed\non the back of a business reply envelope.\nWhen the user tears off a month, he finds\nhimself holding the institution’s message and\na self-addressed contribution envelope.\nArts Management\n[3]\nFebruary 1962"
