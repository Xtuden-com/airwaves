This is one of those vestigial situations which is a\nhangover from the time when the president was elected at the October con¬\nvention and each new president appointed his own committees. However,\nnow that we have a full-time president, there is no need to continue this\npractice, There is one possible difficulty in that members pay their dues\non the basis of a calendar year so that there might be problems of \"eligibility”\nand of appointing people who subsequently drop out. A possible way around\nthis would be to appoint new committees before the October convention but\nfor service starting in January. Under this arrangement each committee could\nmeet at the convention with the new members in attendance. This method\nwould provide for a smoother transition, especially in those instances where\nthere is a change in the chairman. Your suggestion is an excellent one and\nI do not see why we should not put It into effect for next year.\nI didn't get to call you on my way to San Francisco because I was\nre-routed through Chicago. I will be in Detroit May 14-16. The EMC\ndecided to hold their meetings at the McGregor Memorial Union with housing\nat the Park Sheldon. Thank you, though, for all of your efforts in this respect.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWCH/vr\ncc: Harold Hill"
