Harley\nPresident, NAJEB\n1346 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bills\nThank you for your recent letter and also the\ncarbon of your letter to Richard Hull.\nI have heard nothing from you concerning the\nproposal of last year*s PR Committee to seek funds\nto underwrite the appointment of a full time PR\nDirector. Is the National Office in favor of this?\nLou Peneguy was assigned the responsibility of seeking\nfunds but was never given your approval to proceed.\nNow his term of service on the PR Committee has exÂ¬\npired and before asking another member to continue\nthis project I would like to have your assurance that\nthe money is needed for this purpose.\nThis brings up another question I have had for\nsome time. Since the NAEB Conventions are held in\nOctober every year and all committees meet at this time\nwhy are committee appointments made in January rather\nthan in October?\nCordially,\nMarion Corwell, Manager\nEducational Television\nMC:da\ncc: Mr. Lou Peneguy"
