While\nthese are only 21 towns and cities in the Upper Peninsula still they\nare very well scattered on the so-called, “Roof Garden of the United\nStates”.\nI expect to return to the campus Saturday. To and from this dis¬\ntant town in Michigan, my Michigan, is about 1200 miles. Strange,\nisn’t it, that to get to this part of our great state it is most convenient\nto travel in Indiana, Illinois, and across Wisconsin? The return trip\nmay be made by way of the Straits. Should! we come that way we\nshall have encompassed a great portion of the 1750 miles of Michigan’s\nborders of water. I assure you that this opportunity to see the woods\nwith all of their colors and the lakes and streams on every side is be¬\ning very much appreciated, and I think again of—\n“. the dew and damp of meadows,\n. the rushing of great rivers,\n. the thunder in the mountains,\n. the bird’s nests of the forests,\n. the lodges of the beaver,\n. the foot-prints of the bison,\n. the eyrie of the eagle,\n. the moorlands and the fen-lands, and\n. the melancholy marches.”\netc.\nYours very truly,\nCarl Cooper,\nAlumni Secretary,\nWestern State Teachers College.\nMany books deserve careful preservation because of the priceless\nheritage they represent. But books need more than preservation; they\nneed use.\n—Antioch Notes.\n-29-"
