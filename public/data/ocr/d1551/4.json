Bidlack, NAEB TV Engineer\nWe didn’t expect to have much of a column for this issue as the deadline found your\nreporter at home battling a virus in his bronchial tubes. However, now that we're\nback on the job we’ll be able to fill out a page. At any rate here’s our tip for\nthe month - ’’Never trifle with a cold virus. It just isn’t healthy.”\nWe are always happy to know that people read this column and especially so when they\ntake time to write in answer to our pleas for help.\nWe were pleased to have a letter from Raymond Cheydleur of the Florida State Uni¬\nversity in answer to our request, in the December Newsletter, to hear from those\nusing Auricon cameras with TV shutters for making kinescope recordings. They were\nexpecting to receive.their camera as this is being written and are anxious to try\nit out for kinescope purposes. Ray says they’ll be glad to pass on their expe¬\nrience with the Auricon hoping that others may benefit. We’d be happy to hear from\nothers with this equipment."
