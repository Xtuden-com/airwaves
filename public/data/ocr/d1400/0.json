Waple\nActing Secretary\nFederal Communications Commission\nWashington 25/ D, C.\nDear Mr. Waple:\nThere has been some concern among our members relative to the\ncarrying of political broadcasts by educational stations. In view of\nthe fact that all of our educational television stations are themselves\nan integral part of an educational institution or a combination of\nsuch institutions / the question has been raised as to whether the\ncarrying of political programs by educational television stations\nwould affect their tax exempt status with the Internal Revenue Ser¬\nvice. We would appreciate such guidance in these matters as you\nmay be able to give us.\nThank you for your interest and cooperation.\nVery truly yours ✓\nWilliam G. Harley"
