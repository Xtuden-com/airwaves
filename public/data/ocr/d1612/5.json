Would such subsidies result\nin conmereial control of educational stations? What terms and condi¬\ntions should be insisted upon before the F.C.C. approves such a\nsubsidy arrangement? These and scores of other problems lie immed¬\niately ahead 5 education must have a voice in the decisions ,5\nAgain, the rules and regulations may in a variety of ways\nhamper individual educational FM broadcast stations. Thus only re¬\ncently Columbia University was granted its FM licenses, but with a\npower much lower than it had requested. The result was to reduce\nmarkedly the area which Columbia will be able to reach with its broad¬\ncasts. The justification of the decision is that the more power\nColumbia is permitted, the fewer educational stations can be accom¬\nmodated on its channel. But the essential evil is that the decision\nwas made, and may become a precedent, without any consideration on\nthe part of educational broadcasters themselves, and without any\nrepresentation of their interest in the matter. Such decisions are\nhanded down from*month to month, almost from week to week. Contin¬\nuous representation of educational broadcasting interests is\nnecessary in order to keep educators informed of the issues, and to\nspeak in their behalf where educational interests are threatened<,\nIn addition to rules and regulations, the F.C.C. takes a\nvariety of other types of action which may impair educational broad¬\ncasting. For example, in 1940 the F.C.C. negotiated a \"North Ameri¬\ncan Regional Broadcasting Agreement\" which on its face had no\nrelation to education whatever. One obscure clause in the agreement,\nhowever, redefined \"daytime hours\" to begin at sunrise instead of at\n6 a.m. The result was to deprive a number of educational stations"
