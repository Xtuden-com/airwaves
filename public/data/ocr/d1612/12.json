In this and other ways, it may be possible for a strong\neducational PM broadcast station organization to a-'oid the starvation\nbudgets which have destroyed so many stations in the past. The cost\nof educational FK operation is a drop in the bucket of educational\nappropriations; but half of a drop is not enough. Minimum budgets can\nbe drafted below which institutions can be advised not to enter the\nfield at all. In particular, sound advice can be prepared which will\nlessen the possibility of excessive investment in physical plant at the\nexpense of subsequent operating budgets.\n8. Program Experimentation!. In broadcasting generally, it\nis reasonable to believe that the surface of program possibilities has\nbarely been scratched. We Americans have not yet learned to harness\nthe resources of American literature and the arts and sciences generally\nto broadcasting. Types of programs still undreamed may some day -\nperhaps soon - challenge even the Lone Ranger and Bob Hope. The special\ninterests of listening minorities are still under-served. Opportunities\nare unlimited for experimentation; ar.d shortly the stations will be on\nthe air ready to make use of successful results.\nThe wire recorder turns the entire world into one vast studio.\nThe transcription makes every program in the worId potentially avail¬\nable to every station in the world.

Other projects are too big\nlor any single institution, and can best be undertaken by an organization"
