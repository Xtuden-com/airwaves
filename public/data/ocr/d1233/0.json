But they'll notice\nit, and wonder why it isn't up-to-date.\nYou may wonder sometimes too — and think you\ncan't afford a large, convenient bathroom. Perhaps you\ndo lack the cash. But that is not a good excuse for depriv¬\ning y o to* self of needed repairs* Now, under the Moderniza¬\ntion Credit Plan of the Federal Housing Administration\nyou may obtain funds from your local bank to have that\nold-fashioned ba.throom enlarged and brightened up. A\nsteady income and a good credit reputation are the only\nrequirements.\nA modern bathroom means more comfort.for every\nmember of your family. Children really enjoy bathing in\na large shower-bath; tiled floors and walls make cleaning\nalmost a pleasure; that useless closet can be torn out\nand a bigger bathroom with plenty of room for everyone\nand everything can be built.\nModernize your bathroom now. Then your friends\nwill tell you that your bathroom is a convenient, beauti¬\nful, addition to your home.\n* * * *\n(7330)"
