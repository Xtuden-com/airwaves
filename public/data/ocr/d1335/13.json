She should know whether or not\nthe broadcast is designed for classroom\nuse, what subject-matter content it aims\nto cover, and what social attitudes it\nseeks to influence. Those broadcasts\nshould be selected which are, or can be\nmade, relevant to the work going on in\nthe classroom. Occasional exceptions to\nthis are newscasts, actuality or spot\nbroadcasts, foreign broadcasts, and spe¬\ncial events broadcasts. There may be\ncases in which the teacher knows that\nher objectives and those of the broad¬\ncast differ. Under these circumstances\nshe should plan such a utilization of the\nprogram as will best serve her objectives.\nd. Quality of Performance: The\nteacher should select programs which\nare presented as effectively as possible\nin terms of the purposes she has de¬\ntermined upon. She must guard against\nthe danger of selecting programs so\npoorly executed and presented that they\nmay hinder the use of radio as a teach¬\ning device. No matter how worthy the\ncontent and objectives, a radio program\nis ineffective if poorly presented. The\nbroadcast should be conceived and pro¬\nduced primarily in terms of the best\nmodern radio techniques. That is to say,\nthe broadcast material should be so\nchosen and assembled that it is more ef¬\nfective over the radio than if produced\nthrough some other educational medium\nsuch as the theatre, lecture hall, or class¬\nroom. When the broadcast attempts di¬\nrect teaching, simplicity and vividness\nof terminology are prime requisites.\ne. Interest: The material of the broad¬\ncast should be based on the interests of\nthe students, and should serve to stim¬\nulate new interests as well as to deepen\nthose already present. The arousal and\nmaintenance of a high degree of spon¬\ntaneous interest on the part of most\nlisteners to the broadcast should be evi¬\ndent before any broadcast series is used\nregularly for school listening.\n/. Authenticity: The teacher should use\nevery means available to her for check¬\ning the authenticity of the broadcast\ncontent. She should know the source of\nthe broadcast: if educational, what in¬\nstitutions are sponsoring it; if commer¬\ncial, what organizations are using it and\nfor what purposes. She should check the\nmaterial of previous broadcasts from the\nsame or similar sources. She should\nknow how to help the students find\nreferences to corroborate, develop, or\ndisagree with the material as presented.\nHOW PREPARE TO USE\nSCHOOL RROADCASTS?\nSCHOOL broadcast can be eval-\n^ uated apart from its utilization in the\nclassroom. The preparation for the broad¬\ncast, the broadcast itself, and the dis¬\ncussion and follow-up activities which\nit stimulates should be considered as the\ncomponent parts of a single classroom\nunit.\nPreparation for the broadcast may\ninvolve several activities on the part\nof the teacher. In the first place, she\nmust prepare herself. She should know\nthe purpose of the broadcast and plan\nher approach accordingly. She should\nfamiliarize herself, as far as possible,\nwith the form and content of the pro¬\ngram. She should know what resources\nin the way of books, visual aids, and\nother supplementary materials are avail¬\nable. If the program is designed to di¬\nrect some pupil activity such as singing\nor rhythm work, she should know in ad¬\nvance what directions are likely to be\ngiven and how they should be followed,\nso that no time may be lost when the\ndirections actually come over the air.\nIt is important, of course, for the\nteacher to see that the radio is properly\ntuned to the station before the broad¬\ncast begins and that the dial is manipu¬\nlated during the performance whenever\nnecessary for maximum clarity and tone\nquality. This is an activity which, in\nmany cases, can be handled by a pupil\nmonitor who is familiar with the mechan¬\nical adjustments on radio sets."
