Far from\nreplacing the teacher, as many over-\nzealous enthusiasts have predicted, the\nradio can be successful in the schools only\nwith the unceasing aid and criticism of\nthe classroom teacher and the pupils who\nlisten. It is only insofar as it meets their\nneeds that its existence is justified.\nThe necessity for discrimination in\nselecting a program has already been dis¬\ncussed. It is imperative to do more, how¬\never, than accept or reject programs al¬\nready on the air. Teachers and pupils\nwho are responsible critical listeners will\ndo all they can to communicate their re¬\naction to programs to broadcasters. Pro¬\nducers of programs are greatly de¬\npendent on this listener activity for de¬\ntermining the success or failure of their\nbroadcasts. They are eager for any in¬\nformation they can obtain on the re¬\nsponse of their audiences. Writing letters\nto the producers not only accomplishes\nthis, but it helps the children to organize\ntheir ideas and provides one of the few\nways in which they can take positive,\nconstructive action. Teachers and pupils\nmight also send in suggestions for pro¬\ngrams they would like to hear, lists of\nquestions they would like answered and\nsamples of creative work reflecting their\nreactions to radio programs they have\nheard.\nAlthough the actual writing of radio\nscripts and producing of programs must\nbe done by professionally-trained people\nfamiliar with the techniques of radio,1\neducational programs should be planned\naround important educational objectives.\nIn a few cases one finds teachers trained\nboth in classroom procedures and in radio\nproduction actually planning programs,\nbut until there are more of these it is\nthe obligation of every teacher to make\nher educational needs and objectives clear\nto the people who produce radio pro¬\ngrams. It is necessary first of all that\nthese needs and objectives be very clearly\ndefined in the teacher’s own mind. Vague\ngeneral criticisms do not help broadcast¬\ners nearly as much as concrete, well-\nthought-out comments and suggestions.\nAs the teacher uses radio systematically\nshe will come to a deeper understanding\nof its shortcomings, and its possibilities.\nThe results of this thinking must not be\nlost. If teachers are to play an active part\nin determining what radio will bring into\nthe classroom their point of view must\nbe communicated to broadcasters through\nletters, reports, and by participation in\njoint conferences. All teachers must be\nprepared to help radio achieve those\nbroad educational objectives for which it\nis peculiarly fitted as an instrument of\nmass education.\nHOW MAY TEACHERS\nLEARN MORE ABOUT\nRADIO IN EDUCATION?\nNewspapers and Periodicals\nAll daily newspapers have a radio sec¬\ntion which lists the time and station of\nprograms carried locally. A special radio\ncolumn sometimes gives descriptions of\nvarious programs. Some Sunday news¬\npapers give a detailed listing of programs\nfor the entire week.\nRadio Guide, a weekly periodical which\ngives classified listings of programs a\nweek in advance. A special section called\n“Listening to Learn” is devoted to notes\nabout educational programs.\n(1) See “How to Use Radio,” also published by The National Association of Broadcasters, available\nthrough your local station, outlining important fundamentals for teachers and student-production groups\ncontemplating the use of radio."
