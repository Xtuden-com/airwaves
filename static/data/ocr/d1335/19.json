A\nhigh degree of auditory concentration is\napparent because of other activities going\non in the house or even in the same\nroom. . -\nThe first requirement in out-of-school\nprograms which are to be recommended\nfor children is that they be based on\nchildren’s interests. The material of the\nprogram should be closely related to\ntheir background and maturity level be¬\ncause these are the basis for inherent\ninterest. A good program should be one\nwhich promotes the continued interests\nand stimulates the further activity of\nlisteners. Such interest and activity\nmay take the form of intense, concen¬\ntrated listening, recall and correlation\nof related experiences, imaginative elab¬\noration, singing, dancing, dramatic play,\nhobbies, reading, and social welfare ac¬\ntivities. The very process of listening\nwith one’s family and discussing the\nprogram is an important social activity\nin itself. It is also very probable that\ninterest can be stimulated in fields\nhitherto unknown to or unexplored by\nthe child.\nObviously programs should come at\ntimes when they do not interfere un¬\nduly with the child’s outdoor play, his\nmeals or his bed time. The teacher\nshould be sure that the programs to be\nrecommended have a high standard of\ntechnical perfection. They should be\nwell organized, clear and understandable.\nThe programs should also be\nemotionally satisfying. Tales of\ndaring, adventure stories, and\ncertain types of music, may give\nthe child an emotional release\nwhich he does not\nget at any other\npoint during the\nday. The harum-\nscarum daily\nserial should not\nbe blamed for all\nthe present-day ills\nthat childhood is\nheir to. Over¬\nabsorption in this type of program with\nattendant nervousness, night fears or\nother abnormal symptoms are frequently\nsymtomatic of deep-lying maladjustments\nwithin the child which should be investi¬\ngated.\nThe teacher is in a position to recom¬\nmend programs that will fill the personal,\nphysical, and emotional needs of particu¬\nlar children. Although radio programs\nare necessarily designed for mass con¬\nsumption, teacher selection and teacher\nrecommendations should be made on the\nbasis of the needs of the individual child.\nFor instance, a nervous, excitable child\nmight listen to certain types of music\nbefore dinner, or a child having difficulty\nin occupying himself around the house\nmight get valuable suggestions from lis¬\ntening to hobby programs. Choosing a\nsuitable radio program is more difficult\nthan choosing a suitable book, because\nthere is less variety of materials to choose\nfrom. By keeping herself well-informed\nas to what is on the air, the teacher can,\nhowever, greatly aid the child in finding\nsatisfying broadcast to listen to at home.\n*N important criterion for judging the\n** suitability of a radio program, is\nvalidity. If the content is fiction, are the\npeople life-like? Are the situations plaus¬\nible? Are they consistent within the\ntotal framework of the story? If the\nbroadcast material is fantasy, is it pre¬\nsented as such or does it become confused\nin the mind of the child with real life\nsituations? If the material is factual,\nwhat are the sources? Are they reliable?\nHow is the material selected? Is it pre¬\nsented with integrity? Is it clear at what\npoints the material has been altered for\ndramatic purposes? These are all ques¬\ntions which the teacher should be able, to\nanswer for herself before recommending\na program.\nOut-of-school radio programs used to\nsupplement regular school activities\nshould have several qualities not neces¬\nsarily required in school broadcasts of a\nsimilar type. Since the radio is family\nproperty and a form of home reference\nmaterial which has necessarily to be\nshared, educational programs should have\nenough general appeal so that the child is"
