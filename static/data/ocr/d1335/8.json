Frequently a fif¬\nteen-minute educational radio program\ninvolves many hours of preparatory re¬\nsearch and many varieties of specialized\ntalent, before finally being broadcast as\na powerful teaching force.\nThus, without question, radio promises\nto fill a real need in education. The\nrealization of this promise, however, de¬\npends ultimately upon the attitude of\nthe teacher toward radio and upon the\namount of intelligence she bestows upon\nher plans for its utilization in the class¬\nroom.\nWHAT’S ON THE AIR?\nsystems. Some states, notably Wiscon¬\nsin and Ohio, have set up similar state¬\nwide departments. This broadcasting is\ncarried on in some cases over stations ope¬\nrated by school systems, and in others\nby local commercial stations who donate\nthe time on the air. For teachers to whom\nsuch broadcasts are available the prob¬\nlem of using radio is greatly simplified.\nThis includes, of course, not only mem¬\nbers of the particular school system for\nwhich the radio programs are designed,\nbut teachers in outlying districts or\nother cities close enough to pick up the\nbroadcasts.\nSchool broadcasting is undoubtedly\nmore effective when the basic planning\nis done by professional educators who\nare familiar with the degree to which\ncurricular objectives are being attained\nand with the actual needs of the class¬\nroom teacher. We are, however, a long\nway from even partial fulfillment of\nthis condition. The acceptance of the\nradio department as an important ad¬\njunct of the school system must wait\nupon a more complete awareness of the\ncontributions which radio can make\nto the school program.\nTHEORETICALLY, the potential\nvalue of radio to education is as un¬\nlimited as the potential value of the\nwritten word. It is essentially only a\nnew means of communication, and we\nmay do with it, within certain limita¬\ntions, almost anything we wish. Prac¬\ntically, however, as a teaching tool,\nradio is no better or worse than the pro¬\ngrams currently available on the air. For\nexample, a teacher may be not only\nwilling, but eager to use the facilities\nof radio in teaching about the great na¬\ntional problem of conservation. Are\nthere programs dealing with this problem\navailable? If not, when will they be\navailable? Who should produce such\nprograms and what attitude toward con¬\ntroversial aspects of the problem should\ngo on the air?\nA number of cities have, in the last\nfew years, set up radio education de¬\npartments with a staff of educators,\ntrained in the techniques of radio, who\nwrite and produce programs\ndesigned to fill the needs of\nteachers in their own school\nAMONG cities and school systems\nwhich have pioneered in developing\nradio education departments are New\nYork City; Rochester, New York;\nAtlanta, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana;\nCleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan;\nAkron, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Alameda,\nCalifornia; Los Angeles, California;\nBrookings, South Dakota; Grand Forks,\nNorth Dakota; Lawrence, Kansas.\nThe teacher to whom such school-\nplanned broadcasts are\nnot available has, never¬\ntheless, a large field of\nprograms from which to\ndraw.
