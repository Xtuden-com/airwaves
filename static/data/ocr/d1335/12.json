If the pur¬\npose is to provide opportunity for chil¬\ndren to use a public address system, to\nprovide a communication system for\nthe school, and to enable teachers to use\nradio programs in somewhat limited\nfashion, then that purpose will best be\nmet by central receiving equipment.\nNote : For a more complete discussion\nof this problem see Radio-Sound, Equip¬\nment for Educational Use, by R. R.\nLowdermilk, Bureau of Educational Re¬\nsearch, Ohio State University, Colum¬\nbus, Ohio.\nHOW SHALL WE SELECT\nSCHOOL BROADCASTS?\nALTHOUGH there is a great deal of\nvaluable educational material on the\nair, it is not all useful in all situations.\nAlmost as much depends on the proper\nselection of a program as on the quality\nof the broadcast itself. The teacher, who\nknows her own group, is most capable of\nmaking decisions on the basis of that\ngroup’s needs and interests. This applies\nto both school system and commercial\nbroadcasts, although it is perhaps more\nimportant in the case of the latter, be¬\ncause they can not always be planned in\nterms of local curricular requirements.\nHow can the teacher become informed\nabout broadcasts before she uses them\nin her schoolroom? Frequently the\nteacher is not free to listen without her\nclass. It is rarely possible to know ahead\nof time in any great detail what a broad¬\ncast is going to contain. There are cer¬\ntain means of checking, however, which\nthe teacher can and should use. Where\nthe broadcast is educational, manuals,\nstudy aids, and descriptions issued be¬\nfore the broadcast are helpful. Some\nstatement of the policy and purposes of\nthe sponsoring station, institution, or or¬\nganization can usually be obtained. In¬\nformation as to the nature of the pro¬\ngram can frequently be obtained from\nthe radio station on request. Radio\nmagazines and educational radio bul¬\nletins issued by the major networks and\nlocal stations also contain helpful in¬\nformation.\nFollowing are some of the elements\nwhich teachers have found helpful in\nselecting a broadcast for school use:\na. Time: The broadcast should be on\nthe air at a time during the school day\nwhen major administrative adjustments\nwill not be necessary in order that the\nprogram may be heard. The program\nshould fit into the scheduled periods\neasily, unless it is possible to make satis¬\nfactory arrangements with other teach¬\ners for exchange of classes.\nb. Length of Program: Since the real¬\nization of the educational possibilities of\nradio depends upon concentrated listen¬\ning, broadcasts of 15 minutes duration\nare probably preferable to those of a\nhalf-hour’s duration. This is particularly\ntrue with younger children. The teacher\nherself can best judge what length pro¬\ngram is most satisfactory for her group in\nterms of the children’s interests, atten¬\ntion spans, and physical needs. Because\nan integral part of the process of radio\nlistening is the discussion or activity\nbefore and after the broadcast, the\nbroadcast should not take up too much\nof the class period. A great deal of the\nbenefit of the broadcast is lost if the class\nhas to disband immediately after the pro¬\ngram. While it is impossible for the\nteacher to govern the actual length of\nthe program, she can choose programs\nwhich are of appropriate length, or, if\npossible, re-arrange the\nclass schedule to provide\nfor discussion and ac¬\ntivity time.\nc. Teacher Objectives:\nThe teacher should have\nclearly defined in her\nown mind the objectives\nwhich she wishes the\nbroadcast to achieve. She\nshould have checked"
