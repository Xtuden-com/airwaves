What should be the teacher's at¬\ntitude toward out-of-school radio pro¬\ngrams? Because listening to the radio\nhas become a very important item in\nthe leisure-time activities of the child,\nthe teacher who views him as a twenty-\nfour hour rather than an eight-thirty- to\nthree-o’clock person recognizes that this\nimplies some understanding, some co¬\noperation, and, most of all, some ac¬\ntivity on her part. To condemn, ignore,\nor deplore out-of-school listening does\nnot contribute toward solving the prob¬\nlems involved. Because it has become\nan integral part of his life the child\nshould be helped to get from this listen¬\ning the most possible benefit and pleas¬\nure. The approach of the teacher should\nbe positive rather than negative; that\nis, she should build upon what is already\npresent in the child rather than attempt\nto uproot existing tastes or attitudes. It\nis important here as elsewhere that the\nchild maintain his confidence in the\nteacher as a person who is interested in\nhim and who respects him. This posi¬\ntive attitude can be achieved by recom¬\nmending interesting “good” programs\nrather than discrediting “bad” ones.\nOut-of-school listening falls into two\nmain classifications: leisure-time listen¬\ning for “pure enjoyment,” and listening\nfor reference material to supplement\nschool work. These two are not neces¬\nsarily mutually exclusive. It is con¬\nceivable that leisure-time listening for\n“pure enjoyment” could be utilized in\nschool to motivate discussion of adver¬\ntising techniques, as a basis for analysis\nof what makes a story interesting or\nexciting, and for discussion of what con¬\nstitutes a good radio program. Corre¬\nspondingly, if school activities are ac¬\ntually meeting the needs of the child, any\nsupplementary material heard over the\nradio would be “enjoyable.”"
