From\nthe point of view of subject matter,\ngeography, history, civics, English, read¬\ning, spelling, writing, dramatization, and\npublic speaking all entered in. A great\ndeal of pupil research and investigation\nwas done, and an appreciation of such\ninstitutions as government bodies and\npeace organizations, a new interest in\nand a better understanding of several\nmajor social problems, critical thinking\nabout these problems, and tolerance to¬\nward each other’s opinions were all de¬\nveloped to some degree.\nEXAMPLE B\nRural School, Fifth Through Eighth\nGrades\nProgram\n“Istanbul, a Decapitated Capital,” one\nof a series designed to supplement the\nwork in upper elementary geography\nclasses. The broadcasts dramatized the\ntravels of an American family in foreign\ncountries.\nPre-Broadcast Activities\nSince the children had not been study¬\ning this part of the world in their regular\nclass work, it was necessary to lay a\nrather careful foundation for listening.\nSuch activities as these were found\nvaluable.\n1. Map study of the area in which the\nscene was laid\n2. Appointing a committee to mark\nplaces in books where informa¬\ntion about the subject could be\nfound (Supplementary reading was\ncarried on by children in their\nspare time)\n3. Setting up an electrical stereopticon\nmachine with pictures of the\nregion\n4. Teaching the meanings of such\nwords as “Mohammedan,”\n“mosque,” “minaret,” etc.\n5. The mother of one of the pupils had\nlived in Istanbul as a child, so she\nwas invited to listen to the program\nwith the class\nPost-Broadcast Activities\n1. During the discussion following the\nbroadcast these and other points came up:\nReasons for moving the capital\nReasons for the long dry summer\nWhy the Black Sea has bad storms\nin summer\nWhat effect the geography of the\ncountry has had on the customs of\nthe people\nThe Mohammedan religion\nWesternizing influences in the East\nThe Turkish Youth Movement\n2. Several of the children read for\nmore information on phases of the topic\nin which they were particularly interested\n3. A collection of sample products of\nTurkey was made\n4. One of the children made a puppet\ndressed in the native Turkish costume\nComment\nThe program succeeded in giving the\npupils the feeling that Turkey was a\nplace where real people lived rather than\nsomething on a map in a geography book.\nThey gained some familiarity with the\ncustoms of the country and a more sym¬\npathetic understanding of its problem.\nEXAMPLE C\nSeventh Grade\nProgram\nA dramatized story of the discovery of\nvitamins A, B, C, D, and G. This was one\nof a series intended primarily to serve as\na factor in integrating classroom activities\nin different subject matter fields.\nPre-Broadcast Activities\nInterest was first aroused by a discus¬\nsion period several days before the\nbroadcast during which the teacher men¬\ntioned several startling instances of the\neffects of various kinds of food on human\nbeings and animals as shown in the rela¬\ntion of nutrition to such diseases as beri¬\nberi, scurvy, and pellagra. The children\nwere encouraged to tell instances from\ntheir own experience of the importance\nof the right kinds of food. Some reading,\nreports to the class, and discussion were\nengaged in to make sure that the children\nwould be sufficiently familiar with the\ncontent of the program to appreciate it."
