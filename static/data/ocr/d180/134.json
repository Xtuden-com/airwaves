The law of plan fulfillment.\nI will not be held responsible. I'm covering myself.\nI'm writing reports! (PAUSE)\n(SLOWLYâ€”THREATENINGLY) I wouldn't do that if I were\nyou.\nI'm not afraid.\n(ALTERING TO A CONCILIATORY APPROACH) Druzhinin....\nFyodor Stepanovitch, must we fight like children?\nIsn't there something we can do to lick this problem?\nThe new machines, Dimitri Ivanovich. If we could get\nthem in operation it'd take the load off the others.\nI've tried every trick in the trade to get the fan\nbelts for those machines. That guy in Moscow is\nafraid of his shadow. He won't blow his nose without\nwritten permission in six copies.\nIt's a shame. Brand new machines and we can't use them.\nThe devil with all their promises! What we can't get\nlegally, we'll get some other way.\nThe supply trouble-shooter?\nWhy not? He hasn't failed us yet. Remember how he\ncame through with those pulley wheels six months ago?\nSneaked them from right under the nose of the Ministry.\nHe's a smart trouble-shooter all right.\nHe has influence. Knows when and where to invest a\nfew roubles or arrange a few favors, eh? (SLY LAUGH)\nWell, they say there's nothing like pull. (BOTH MEN\nLIGHT LAUGH ) .\nThere you see, we, engineers, can solve our problems."
