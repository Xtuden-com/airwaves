As you can see, the Soviet\nworker shares his lunch hour with the agitator, a\nworker from his own ship whose added duty it is to\ncarry the message of the Communist Party to the\nworkers. There are two basic themes on which the\nagitator bases his appeal. The first is fear - fear\nof attack from the capitalist countries. The second\nis hope - hope for a better life.\nThese two themes have been used for thirty years by\nthe Soviet regime to push and pull the workers to\ngreater effort. Listen to what one Soviet refugee,\na woman worker, told us about these agitation sessions....\nThey told us that we had paradise, and that the\ncapitalist worker was hungry, and was dying at an early\nage from overwork. And I actually believed we were in\nparadise. And the situation was the way it was because\nit had to be. They told us when communism would come\nwe would all work according to our abilities and\nreceive according to our needs. They said that a\ncleaning woman who got 60 rubles now would get 1,000\nrubles then. Sometimes I actually believed that.\nAfter five year plans, we would have communism and\nit would be such a wonderful life. And some believed\nit. Those who knew a little about politics if they\nwanted to say something against it they were unable to.\nDid you yourself believe these things?\nI did not usually. But I had to quiet my soul. I had\na very unexciting life. I had to do something. So\nsometimes I thought, \"Well, maybe it really will come true\nCUED fAUSE.\nPAUSE:"
