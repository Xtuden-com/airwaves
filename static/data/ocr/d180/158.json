These same\nquestions have been faced by the distinguished author of\nStrange Lands And Friendly People, the book from which\nthe foregoing happenings in the Middle East have been\ntaken. Mr. Justice William 0. Douglas of the United States\nSupreme Court has traveled among these new neighbors of\nours on the other side of the world, he has talked with\nthem in their villages and in their towns. And he has\nbeen deeply moved. Justice Douglas."
