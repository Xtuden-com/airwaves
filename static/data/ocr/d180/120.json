That Doctor\nKonevskaya at the clinic is giving out too many\ncertificates of illness to the workers. Then, our\nMechanical Engineer is pulling against us. He resists\npushing his machines so hard. And finally, many of\nthe workers are not fulfilling their work quotas.\nThey're tired.\nThey may be tired but they can give more. Let's get\nthe agitators working on this problem.\nI?ll talk with the Party Secretary about the\nagitators.\nAnd I111 get to our Mechanical Engineer first thing\nin the morning.\nWhat about Doctor Konevskaya?\nEvidently that reprimand was not enough. I think I!ll\ndrop in at the clinic tomorrow for a check-up and have\na little talk with her.\nThere1s something else. Those workers who belong to\nthe Communist Youth League, they're getting out of\nhand.\n(EXASPERATEDLY) Those kids, they're forever getting\ncarried away by their own slogans.\nThat's just the trouble. They1re making a pest of\nthemselves. Going around criticizing everybody and\neverything in the factory. We better be on the\nlookout tonight at the meeting."
