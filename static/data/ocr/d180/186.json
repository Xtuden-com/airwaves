The Communists are trying\nto capture it and lead it away from the goals of liberty,\nequality and fraternity and turn it through class wars\nand fear into a totalitarian dictatorship, live can save\nthis revolution from the Communists by being prepared to\ndefend it by military and economic means; but we cannot\nsave the Asians from slavery by economic or military aid\nalone no matter how generous,nor by arousing their fears\nno matter how real. We Americans can contribute to peace,\nprogress and good will among the millions of Asia by giving\nthem our respect, our friendship and understanding and\nwith these a reaffirmation of the freedoms and responsi¬\nbilities that are the foundation of our way of life."
