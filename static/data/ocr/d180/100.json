I will simply play for you some pieces\nbased on natural folk song melodies which the Soviets\nregard as democratic music, that is as pro-people\nmusic, and then melodies that are more artificial,\nthat is, modern melodies which the Soviets regard as\nanti-people. Now I will illustrate the one kind, the\npre-194$ kind and the post-194# kind. (PAUSE) Now\nhere is a melody from Shostakovich1s Cello Sonata which\nwas written in 1934 and which was regarded as following\nthe popular idiom, that is, the idiom understandable\nto the masses.\niMUSIC: _\n_PIAN0i\nSLONIMSKY:\nOn the other hand a prelude by Shostakovich written at\nabout the same time abounds in all kinds of strange\nmelodic turns. Now this kind of composition was\n(MUSIC:\nregarded as anti-democratic, anti-people.\nPIANO)\nSLONIMSKY:\nNow here is an example from Prokofiev, the famous\nPeter and the Wolf inarch.\n(MUSIC:\nPIANO)\nSLONIMSKY:\nNow this of oourse has a straight melody so it was\naccepted by the masses. On the other hand, in a piece\nthat Prokofiev wrote after 194#, that is who n he was\nnot sufficiently reformed despite the resolution of the\nCommunist Party in favor of the so-called Soviet melody,\nhe wrote a childrens chorus in his cantata, iJ0n Guard\nfor Peace,which incidentally received the Stalin\nprize, and there its melody was much more complicated\nand therefore criticized.\n(MUSIC:\nPIANO)"
