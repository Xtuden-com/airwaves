The Soviet\nfactory is a major key to understanding the weaknesses\nand strengths of Communist Russia.\nWe would like to take you inside one of those factories\nfor a night and a day—to expose its inner workings to\nyour view—as it was exposed to our view by former\nSoviet directors, engineers, and workers who escaped\nto the West. In developing this documentary we have\ndrawn on the experiences—in many cases the very words—\nof former Soviet citizens as they told American inter¬\nviewers the story of their lives in Soviet factories."
