Have you by any chance, Mr. Slonimsky,\nheard any of it?\nOh, yes, I have heard it. In fact I have the music of\nsome of his post-1943 compositions. Now what strikes\nme in the whole Prokofiev business was that he was the\nonly one who did not recant completely. I will play\nfor you a few tunes from his work, ,?Guarding the\nPeace,** the work that was written in 1950 and generally\npraised, and you will find that it is definitely not\naccording to Hoyle, that is, not according to Soviet\nHoyle.\n_PIAN0j_ ^GUARDING THE PEACEâ€˜0\nSoviet critics said that this is not exactly a singable\nmelody, and this was written for a children1s chorus,\nwhich means that Prokofiev just can?t help himself;\nhe wanted, and at least he said that he wanted, to\nwrite melodically, but this is not melody in the\nPickwickian sense, I mean in the Soviet sense."
