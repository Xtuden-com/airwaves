Plans no matter how\nenergetic and sincere must still be realistic. Isn’t\nthat so, Comrade Party Secretary?\n(SLIGHTLY OFF MIKE...HEDGING AT FIRST) Yes, this is\ntrue, plans must be realistic and, of course, the\nparty respects the opinions of its older workers.\nBut, on the other hand, no obstacle is too great for\na true Bolshevik to overcome.\n(OFF MIKE PROJECTING) Comrade Party Secretary, I bow\nto the wisdom of the director in such technical matters\nand withdraw my pledge. I don’t know the plant as well\nas the director but I know my machine. And I, Kolya\nBakin, as an example to all, will double my work quota\ntomorrow.\nA noble pledge, Comrade Bakin. I have made careful\nnotes during your excellent critique, and with the\nexception of the idle machines—which are not in use\nbecause we were never supplied the fan belts for them—\nwith I say this important exception—your comments are\nwell taken. (DEMAGOGICALLY) Comrades, I am particularly\nshocked by the report on our factory canteen. (POSSIBLE\nEARLY FADE POINT) This cannot continue this way. If\nwe ask you to fulfill and over-fulfill your work quotas,\nyou are obliged to demand (FADE) from us that we take\ncare of you. (UNDER.... SLOWLY OUT) And we will take\ncare of you. These delays will not be tolerated any\nlonger. I assure you that we will make every effort to\nremedy this intolerable situation. My only wish is that\nI could have known of this sooner...."
