What the people did not\nnotice was that soon, the Leader asked questions - and\ngave his own answers as well. Who had shown the way to\nfreedom? Sun Yat Sen. Who had betrayed him? Chiang\nKai-Shek. Who supported Chiang? Americans and British.\nWhy? Because they were capitalist countries and wanted\nChina as a source of cheap labor and as a dumping ground\nfor their surplus goods. And so forth. Hatred was the\ntheme. The young hotheads began to agitate for revenge,\nredressâ€”scapegoats. But the Leader would listen to no\ntalk of violence...\n(OFF SLIGHTLY) There will bo no violencel We have other\nproblems. For example - I warn you - you will have\nbanditry here because arms remain hidden in your homes,\nunregistered with us. I warn you as a friend!\nBut many arms caches had been revealed. People were\nconstantly reporting small offenses of no consequence.\nThe Leader asked it. What harm in it? and everybody\nwanted to be cooperative. (BEAT) A new village elder\nhad been selected at one mooting. A younger man.\nThey can indoctrinate the young.\nThen the young men from 16 to 30 were interviewed one\nby one with courteous and fatherly interest. I confess,\nI was won by the LeaderTs charm and interest...\nHow old are you, Wang?\nTwenty-three,\nCOM\nFarmer?"
