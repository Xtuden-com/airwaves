Then later on it would appear that I devote\nmyself entirely to making money with the aid of Wall\nStreet, and that for my extremism and formalism and\npure discord and absolute clowning at the piano and\nfor the waving of my non-existent black marcelled locks\nthat I get paid huge sums of money from Wall Street,\nwhich of course means that I am no longer a promising\ncomposer.\nAll of which reminds me, Mr. Taylor, that the Soviets\nof course in their recent pronouncements on music have\nbeen naturally rather partial to their own compositions.\nAs a matter of fact I have heard it said that over the\nlast thirty-five years the Soviets have produced perhaps\nthe finest volume of music, finer than that of any other\ncountry in Western Europe or America. Would you care\nto comment on that kind of generalization?\nThat leaves me a little bewildered. I canft believe\nthat Soviet Russia in the last thirty-five years has\nturned out more fine music than any other country. I\ndonTt know that I have any huge volume of facts to\nback me up but in my opinion that is not so.\nWell, if you were asked for example to indicate the\nmost popular composers—let us leave American composers\nfor the moment out of it—from Russia or Western Europe\nthat are now played on our radio, let us say daily,\nwhich names would occur to you as the most popular?"
