Arrests\nran into the hundreds of thousands. Prisoners were packed\ninto cells like sardines, and subjected, during the night, to\nbrutal, relentless interrogations. Squads of examiners con¬\ncentrated on a single prisoner with only one object in view:\nto extract a confession, true or false, fantastic or plausible—\nbut in any case, a confession. Once a confession was extracted,\nthe prisoner was returned to his overcrowded cell and waited\nusually for the decision of an NKVD administrative tribunal—\nannounced to him by a prison official. The common run of pris¬\noners received sentences of three, five, or ten years in cor¬\nrectional labor camps. Had not these people all signed confes¬\nsions admitting they had participated in treasonable schemes\nand plots to overthrow the Soviet power? Leading Communists,\nsome of them fanatical supporters of Stalin, ironically enough,\nwere caught up in this indiscriminate purge. The leadership\nof the Red Army was decimated. Bureaucrats from every depart¬\nment of the Soviet government - diplomats, trade union officials,\nKomsomol leaders, trust directors, along with writers and scien¬\ntists, vanished behind the walls of the NKVD prisons-and were\nfollowed by their friends, colleagues, and subordinates. A\nmere denunciation was frequently sufficient to start the pro¬\ncess that ended in a prison camp or, often enough, the execu¬\ntion cellar. This, the Great Purge, represents terror gone\n-more-"
