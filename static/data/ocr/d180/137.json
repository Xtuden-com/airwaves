But allow me to explore what you say a\nbit farther. Maybe this worker does become hospitalized,\nloses two weeks as you say. But maybe he doesn't.\nMaybe he finds out he's not so sick after all.\nIsn't it logical to expect that when men are tired from\nworking long hours, sickness is likely to increase?\nSome are sick...some, only looking for an easy way out.\nThere are people, you know, who try to take advantage\nof our government's free medical care..\nIt is not always easy to know who is sick and who is\nnot sick, Comrade Director. If I send a man back to\nwork and he collapses or has an accident on the job,\nI can be brought to trial, charged with neglect of\nduty..an enemy of the people.\nWhat are you? Afraid of your shadow? Afraid to move?\nWhere would the factory be if I didn't take a few\nchances? Do you think the plan would be met? A\nSoviet administrator, Anna Konevskaya, must be\nresourceful.\nBut I'm more than an administrator. I'm a doctor.\nA doctor must think of his patient first. He must\nbelieve...believe in his patient. A human being\nsuffers.... suffers. And the doctor reaches out not to\nscold him or push him but to understand....to help.\nAh, an idealist'. (LAUGHS)\n(INDIGNANTLY) Comrade Director'."
