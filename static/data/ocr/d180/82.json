However, the resolution of the Central\nCommittee of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. in\n194$ condemned \"the formalist tendency in Soviet music\nas being anti-people.\" How can you compel music to\nreflect the ideology of the Soviet State? What is\nanti-people!s music and what is pro-people*s music?\nWhat happens to talented composers when they are\ncompelled to write music to order? What is the nature\nof the machinery which the Communist Party uses to\nregiment music? These and other baffling questions on\nthe state of music and musicians will be considered in\nthis program. Examples of Soviet music which have been\naccepted and then officially condemned will be played\nand discussed, with the aid of the distinguished\ncomposers and musical critics, Mr. Deems Taylor,\nMr. Henry Cowell, and Mr. Nicolas Slonimsky.\nMURADELI'S \"WILL OF_STALIN\":_ ESTABLISHFADE BACKJORO\nWe are listening to \"The Will of Stalin Led Us\" by the\nSoviet composer, Vano Mu^adeli. Another work by this\ncomposer, an opera entitled \"THE GREAT FRIENDSHIP,\" was\nthe match that fired a powder keg under the whole\nmusical world of Russia in 1948. Not only was Muradeli\ncaught in the explosion, but some of the greatest names\nin music today: Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Khachaturian,\nMiaskovsky.\n(PAUSE)\njmUSELVS \"WILL OF_STALIN\" JJP CONCLUDES!"
