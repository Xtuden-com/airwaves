Sometimes they guess wrong. Now\nfor instance, they were roundly belabored by the\nCentral Committee of the Communist Party for guessing\nwrong before 194$, when they actually recommended some\ncompositions that were later on condemned for Stalin\nprizes; so the thing is done through this entirely\nprofessional organization and they are trying to guess\nwhat the so-called masses want, or as Mr, Taylor correctly\nput it, what the Centred Committee of the Soviet Union\nwants as being representative of the masses.\nWhat about the composer who doesn?t conform, Mr.\nSlonimsky? What actually happens to him?\nComposers who don't conform don't exist, because in\norder to exist, that is physically exist, otherwise,\none has to conform. To try to write a piece in the\nSoviet Union in the twelve-tone system of Schoenberg\none would have to do it in his own attic and never\nshow it to anybody because it would be a hopeless\nundertaking; he would only put himself on the black\nlist.\nHe could get a nice job in a coal mine, couldn't he?\nNo, I doubt even that. I think that he would just quietly\nstarve, and the chances are that he /would certainly not\nwrite such a piece, and if he would write such a piece\nas absolutely non-conformist, he would not show it to\nanybody."
