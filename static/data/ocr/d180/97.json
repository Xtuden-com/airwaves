I think Prokofiev saves\nhis figurative neck by the fact that his natural idiom\nis much less drastic than that of Shostakovich. It\nis rather square-toned and diatonic in comparison with\nShostakovich. On the other hand there is one very\ngreat composer who is a Russian but I don’t know\nwhether he is accepted by the Soviet Union or not—\nthat is, Mr. Stravinsky.\nMr. Slonimsky.\nWell, Mr. Taylor, Stravinsky is certainly not accepted\nin Russia as a representative of Russian music. He is\nusually referred to as that arch reactionary, hypocrite\nin hermit’s clothes, that sanctimonious, perverse\nindividual who has renounced his native heritage and\nfirst became a Frenchman and then drifted to that country\nof bestial capitalism, the United States, and then of\ncourse Wall Street again comes into play here; and now\nwith Stravinsky I can state definitely that every work\nbeginning with Petrushka is out, that Stravinsky is\naccused of betraying the teaching he received from\nRimsky-Korsakov. So this Stravinsky is regarded as\nthe arch enemy musically of Russian music, but it is\nalways underlined that he had talent and even genius\nup to 1909."
