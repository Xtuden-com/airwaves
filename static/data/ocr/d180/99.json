I should say that Schoenberg of\ncourse is regarded as a reactionary. You see, all our\nideas about reaction and progressiveness are fairly\nwell reversed in the Soviet Union. There have been\narticles—one article after another—about Shostakovich\nas an arch reactionary, a man who contributes to the\ndestruction of music rather than the creation of new\nelements for a new music.\nWell, aren!t the Soviets leaving out one obvious factor\nin the total development of music over the ages, Mr.\nSlonimsky? IsnTt it true, and I presume it is true,\nthat at any given moment in the development of a\ncomposerfs art over the centuries, his music when\ninitially (if he were a great composer) when initially\nplayed, has always represented a certain degree of\nunintelligibility to the mass audience?\nYes, you could not put it in a better way. As a matter\nof fact it is now my immediate occupation to publish a\nlexicon of musical invective which I have compiled and\nwhich cites criticisms, and very harsh criticisms,\nbeginning with Beethoven. Every great composer was\nregarded as a destroyer of established values.\nWell, I must say that as I listen to a great deal of\nSoviet music I am frankly mystified as to what they\nconsider anti-people and music that is intellible to\nthe masses of the people. Maybe you can shed some\nlight on this, Mr. Slonimsky?"
