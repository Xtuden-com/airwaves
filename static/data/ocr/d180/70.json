  "text": "-32-\nGLIKSMAN: in the middle of a room, with a greasy, muddy floor—dirty—\n(CONT.)\neverybody was spitting on it, and I began to undress. I kept\nmy suit of clothes in my hand and waited. The officer became\nangry. \"What are you waiting for? Undress completely and throw\naway what you have in your hands.\" I had no choice. With one\nkick of his feet, he threw it into a corner and began the search.\nHe was searching, in all details, my body; made me bend over\nand raise my hands, all other kinds of exercises, to find out\nwhether nothing was hidden. But not only the efficiency of\nthe search, but the way he did it, the degrading words he used,\nthe insulting remarks and jokes, was something that is difficult\nto forget.\nWhen he was through with me, he pushed me to the wall and\ntold me, \"Don’t turn back,\"—pushed me nearer, closer to the\nwall, as I touched my nose to the wall, and then he began\nsearching my clothes. Then, all of a sudden, he was in a hurry.\nHe shouted, \"Be dressed.'\"\nFAINSOD: Now, after this long examination was over, were you released?\nGLIKSMAN: No. Then I was put into a prison cell; and then you can\nwait for a long, long time before one night something happens,\nand these are interrogations. I didn't have too many, but a\nscore or so, and always at night; but other people were taken\nday and night, but mostly at night, for weeks and days on\nend. All of a sudden, one day they gave back my belongings\nand told me that I was free."
