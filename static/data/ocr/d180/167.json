  "text": "-36-\nFISHER:\nThat bell we rang in Philadelphia a hundred and\nseventy-five odd years ago gave notice to the world\nthat we believed all men had certain unalienable rights\nlife - liberty - and the pursuit of happiness. The\nbarriers to these rights in Asia are not the same as\nthose our ancestors overcame nearly two centuries ago.\nThe threats to life, liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness come from despotism, but a twentieth century\ndespotism armed with twentieth century weapons of\npersuasion and coercion. We are learning what these\nnew barriers and threats are. But we learn slowly and\nhistory is being made with the speed of the machinery\nthat is changing our world. We must learn faster and\nwe must decide to apply what we learn. Just two decades\nago China stood where Persia and other Middle Eastern\ncountries stand today. We did not learn fast enough and\nwe did not begin soon enough in China to use what we\nknew. China has taken that Communist detour - that\nshort cut to felicity through catastrophe. Our failure\nhas made it worse for China, worse for us and worse for\nall the world. But this need not mean that all of Asia\nmust follow ChinaTs path or that China will never turn\nher\nfrom . 1 path. The question is, have we learned\nanything?"
