I wonder\nwhether you feel that if music has to cater to what\nyou might call a mass intelligibility, does that\nseriously interfere with the composer*s art?\nI think it very seriously and very emphatically does\ninterfere because what it boils down to is that he must\nwrite music—only such music as will have immediate\nacceptance by a musically illiterate audience. Well,\nthatTs true enough that music can be good and still have\nimmediate acceptance, but it doesnTt necessarily mean\nthat thatTs the only kind of music that’s good or that\nit will eventually be accepted. I think that the Soviets\nleave no margin for any growth in appreciation of music.\nIf everything must be a tune rather than a theme, music\nwill remain static. It allows no room for experimenta¬\ntion either in content or in form*\nI am wondering very much whether people really like\nmusic all alike all the time* Don’t you think that the\nperson who decides what people like usually think they\nonly like one thing, whereas people really like a very\nwide variety of things? I wonder then what is music\nwhich is of the people, and what is music which could\npossibly be opposed to the people.\nWell, isn’t it clear that certainly the Soviets would not\nregard a Schoenberg as music for the people?\nWell, they probably wouldn’t and yet Schoenberg is a\nperson, and there are a great deal of people who have a\ngreat deal of interest and appreciation of Schoenberg.\nAre there no such people in Russia?"
