What\nwould you think about that, Mr, Taylor?\nI should say that his musical future is all in the past.\nHe stopped being Shostakovich and he has gone back to\nRahf or early Brahms. It is perfectly harmless music.\nMr, Cowell.\nI think that in the tunes of this song, in which he\nobserves what certainly appears to be enforced\nsimplicity, that these tunes are in themselves not\nShostakovich but that you can find the same tunes in\nthe work of almost any other composer both from earlier\nRussian composers and from other Western composers of\na forrre r age.\nWell, it would almost seem, Mr. Cowell, then, that these\nefforts of the Soviet musical officials are pretty\nhopeless; that Western influences, like murder, will\nout. But let us remember that other famous composers\nseemed to have successfully recanted their formalistic\nWestern sins and won Stalin prizes since the purification\ndrive of 194$; for example, Khachaturian and Prokofiev.\nDo you happen to know, Mr. Slonimsky, whether Khachaturian*\nbrilliant and original musical idiom has been sacrificed\nto mass intelligibility in his latest pieces?"
