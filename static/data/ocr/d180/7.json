I am asking you to step into the\nsituation in the class and—\nYou know, I always prefer that the children solve their\nown conflicts and it usually works out all right. I\nmyself step in only in an emergency.\nIn the present situation I am going to request—I am\ngoing to insist—that you take decisive steps. I demand\nthat you give another seat to that—what's his name?\nDick?\nI believe they call him ‘'Snowball.i? Put your Snowball\nand the other members of his race in the back seats. ,\nI should insult a boy who is fine in every respect?\nBecause he is a Negro? I will not do that. I gave my\nword to my student, Dick Dempsey, that nobody will dare\nto prevent him from studying in thus school.\nYou are a dangerous man, Mr# Thompson! You are especially\ndangerous because you can instil sympathy for the harmful\nand useless ideas which you preach. Ifll be frank with\nyou—I’m a busy man, and I did not intend to get tied\nup with the school at the present time. My daughter\ncomplained she was treated badly and I merely wanted\nto rectify that. But now I have run into you. You\nare not the right person to be heading this school.\nDo you think so?"
