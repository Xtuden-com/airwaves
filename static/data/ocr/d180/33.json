I wonder\nwhether you feel that if music has to cater to what\nyou might call a mass intelligibility, does that\nseriously interfere with the composer*s art?\nI think it very seriously and very emphatically does\ninterfere because what it boils down to is that he must\nwrite*only such music as will have immediate acceptance\nby a musically illiterate audience. Well, thatâ€™s true\nenough that music can be good and still have immediate\nacceptance, but it doesn't necessarily mean that that's\nthe only kind of music, or that it will eventually be\naccepted. I think that the Soviets leave no margin for\nany growth in appreciation of music. If everything must\nbe a tune rather than a theme, music will remain static.\nIt allows no room for experimentO'eithor in content or\nin form.\nI am wondering very much whether people really like\nmusic all alike all the time. Don't you think that the\nperson who decides what people like usually think^ they\nonly like one thing , whereas people really like a very\nwide variety of things. I wonder then what is music\nwhich is of the people, and what is music which could\np.ssibly be opposed to the people.\nWell, I must say that as I listen to a great deal of\nSoviet music I am frankly mystified as to what they\nconsider anti-people and music that is intelligible to\nthe masses of the people. Maybe you can shod some\nlight on this, Mr. Sloninsky?"
