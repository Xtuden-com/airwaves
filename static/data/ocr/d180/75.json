Then you use\nyour sleeve to dry yourself, ran to the kitchen for the morn¬\ning \"kasha,” a kind of gruel, a few spoonfuls. Then you are\nready. From a distance you hear music, a band playing to cheer\nus up. We are waiting, and then brigade after brigade we are\nconducted into the wood for work. It is still dark. We go\nunder guards and their dogs.\nHow long was your working day?\nAccording to regulations, our work day was two hours longer\nthan the normal work day of a Soviet worker. Until the out¬\nbreak of the war, our work day was supposed to be ten hours.\nAfter the outbreak of the war, twelve hours a day, but in\nfact, they made us work sometimes an hour or sometimes longer\nin order to fulfill the assignment of the day. But if you add\nthe hours we were walking to and from, the hours we were\nwaiting for the morning roll call in the cold, in the snow, you\ncould say that we were on our feet 15, 16 and sometimes 17\nhours a day.\nWill you tell us how you were fed, Mr. Gliksman?\nOur food depended on our output. Each function had its quota,\neach smallest function of the camp was calculated in the daily\nquota that they called \"norm” that had to be fulfilled, and\nif fulfilled, gives you a hundred per cent. But woe to these\nwho couldn't fulfill it, and the quota was so high that the\ngreat majority of prisoners, with their best will could at\nbest perform 50 or 60 per cent of the quota."
