Now what strikes\nme in the whole Prokofiev business was that he was the\nonly one who did not recant completely. I will play\nfor you a few tunes from his work, \"Guarding the Peace,\"\nthe work that was written in 1950 and generally praised,\nand you will find that it is definitely not according\nto Hoyle, that is, not according to-Soviet Hoyle.\n_PIAN0_: \"GUARDING THE FEACE\"J.\nSoviet critics said that this is not exactly a singable\nmelody, and this was written for a children1s chorus,\nwhich means that Prokofiev just cahTt help himself;\nhe wanted, and at least he said that he wanted, to\nwrite melody, but this is not melody in the Pickwickian\nsense, I mean in the Soviet sense.\nMr. Cowell.\nI was wondering if perhaps we couldnTt speak about a\nchange of policy there, because at one time Mr.\nSch^eerson, who had a great deal to do with music\nrepresentative of the official point of view,seems to\nhave changed his mind about a number of Westerners.\nThere was a time, for instance, when my own music was\npraised by him and when I was referred to as being among\nthe more promising composers in this country, which at\nthis time was not meant as a harsh criticism. Then later\non it would appear that I devote myself entirely to\nmaking money with the aid of Wall Street, and that for\nmy extremism and formalism and pure discord and absolute\nclowning at the piano and for the waving of my nonÂ¬\nexistent black marcelled locks that I get paid huge sums\n-more-"
