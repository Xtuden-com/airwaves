They*11 say, \"Well, youfve\nwritten four string quartets, now you've got to lay\noff string quartets and write an overture.5'\nI think this is a slight exaggeration. They urge\ncomposers to write meIodically, whatever this word may\nmean, and the Central Committee urges the Union of\nSoviet Composers, and the Union of Soviet Composers\nurge themselves, because they are the composers, to\nwrite choral piecesâ€”to write for voice rather than\nto write for the instruments.\nIs there a disposition on the whole to denounce\ninstrumental or symphonic music as against vocalic\nmusic, operas?\nYes, absolutely. There is no definite denunciation but\nthere is criticism of Soviet composers, particularly of\ncomposers like Prokofiev and Miaskovsky, to some extent\nShostakovich, that they fail to write vocal music, which\nis supposed to be the natural form of self-expression\nin music.\nAnd is also the most restricted.\nVery true, so here we have a struggle there, but I don't\nbelieve it would be accurate to say that the Union of\nSoviet Composers actually prescribes the form of\ncomposition; otherwise Prokofiev would not have written\neight sonatas, Miaskovsky wouldn't have written\ntwenty-seven symphonies, etc., etc."
