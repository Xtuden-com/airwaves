Once more, the labor\ncamps were supplied with large, fresh contingents of victims as\na result; those who had willfully taken up arms against the\nSoviet state were, in most cases, summarily executed.\nWhat is it like to be a victim of the terror? Some of those\nwho suffered either as Soviet citizens or as citizens of one\nof the occupied countries, have lived to report their stories.\nOne of them, Mr. Jerzy Gliksman, formerly a Polish citizen, and\nnow a citizen of the United States, has set down the details\nof his own experience in his book, \"Tell the West,\" published\nin English by the Gresham Press in 1948. Mr. Gliksman^ aic-\ncount is remarkable for the objectivity with which he was able\nto report the harrowing impact of the terror upon the mind and\nbody of a victim. His story takes on added interest for many\nof us because Mr. Gliksman was the half-brother of Victor\nAlter, one of the leaders of the Socialist movement in Poland.\nIt will be recalled that Victor Aiterâ€™s execution by the Soviet\ngovernment, along with that of his colleague, Henry K. Erlich,\ncaused worldwide protests when it finally became known in 1943.\nMr, Gliksman was a Warsaw lawyer in 1939, and a member of the\nWarsaw City Council. He holds degrees from the Sorbonne and\nthe University of Warsaw; and has taught at Roosevelt College,\nChicago. Here is Dr. Fainsod to interview Mr. Gliksman."
