But let us remember that other famous composers\nseem to have successfully recanted their formalistic\nWestern sins and won Stalin prizes since the\npurification drive of 194$; for example, Khachaturian\nand Prokofiev. Do you happen to know, Mr. Slonimsky,\nwhether Khachaturian*s brilliant and original musical\nidiom has been sacrificed to mass intelligibility in\nhis latest pieces?\nYes. Khachaturian as well as Shostakovich, and to a\nlesser extent other composers, have undoubtedly\nsacrificed their musical integrity in trying to adapt\nthemselves to the so-called people*s idiom.\nMr. Taylor.\nIt seems to me that in one respect the Soviet musical\nauthorities are certainly hopelessly not Westernâ€”I\nmean that we will never get together, I don*t think,\nin our standards because they have gone a step beyond\nTsarist Russia. Now in the days of the tsars,\nmusicians* products were judged by the political\naspects of words that he happened to set to music.\n-more-"
