Well I\ndon't. But I know if I don't push, someone else will.\nAnd harder..much harder. If the plan isn't met,\nthere'll be trouble for everyone. We're all in this\ntogether.\nOf course, we here in the clinic want to help--\nThen take care in giving out these certificates of\nillness. You know if you continue to give out so\nmany, someone at party headquarters is liable to\nthink you're trying to sabotage production\n(PROTESTINGLY) Sabotage? Why that's not soâ€”\nA nasty word and, of course, untrue. But some people\nare quick to jump to conclusions. They're liable to\nthink you're against the Soviet system.\n(NERVOUSLY) This is not true..not true.\nI say all this for your own good. It is a messy thing\nto be investigated by the secret police. So be sensible,\nDoctor Konevskaya. See that your clinic cuts down, way\ndown, on these certificates of illness.\nLIGHT STING SWmmjTO A STOP (CUT 9)\nIs Doctor Konevskaya in need of a reprimand, Comrade\nDirector?\nThat will not be necessary, Comrade Party Secretary,\nI had a long talk with her this morning.\nI know.\nShe assures me we have her complete cooperation.\nYou know, some of these people we talk and talk to,\nand then sometimes we have to stop talking and do\nsomething."
