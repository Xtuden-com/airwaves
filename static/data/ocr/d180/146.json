Look at the speed he\nwas running the machine at. Is it any wonder it broke\ndown?\n(QUICKLY-D3FENSIVELY) I didn’t have it on that speed\nall day. Just near the end. See? I had to be sure.\nI had to be sure I’d break the record.\n(ANGRILY) Break the record? Do you think this is the\nway the party wants you to break a record? Racing a\nmachine? What kind of a Stakhanovite are you? Any\nfool can turn up the speed. It takes a great workman\nto devise new methods to up production. Look...look\nat that shaft. Twisted...twisted.\n(HALF ALOUD—TO SELF) Beyond repair..beyond repair.\nWhat will I do? Where will I get the spare part?\nI didnft mean anything.\n(CONTINUES MUMBLING TO SELF) Turn my back and this is\nwhat they do to me. (CONTINUES AD-LIBBING OFF MIKE)\n(ALMOST CRYING) I’m sorry..I’m sorry..\n(CALMING DOWN) I know that, Kolya, but that doesn’t fix\nthe twisted shaft. What did you do to your arm?\n(NOTICING FOR THE FIRST TIME) I—I guess in the confusion\nI banged it against the machine.\nThat’s a bad scrape, boy. You better go to the clinic\nand have them fix it up for you. (CALLS OUT) Vendeev.#\nComrade Vendeev.\n(QUICK CONE ON) Yes, Comrade Director.\nGo with Kolya to the clinic.\n(SYMPATHETICALLY) Come on, Kolya.\n(NERVOUSLY) No, no. (QUICK FADE OFF) I have to go some\nplace."
