Afternoon of\na Faun,'* which was hissed in 1$92, and now it is almost\nchildishly simple.\nYes. Well, that is of the music of the people, isn't\nit?\nDoesn't all this amount to saying that art after all\nmust be either static or retrogressive? Mow no\nliterary artist today would think, if he wore writing\nanything of the nature of epic poetry today, that he\nwould necessarily have to go back to the epic poetry\nof Homer or Virgil. Does it not amount to the\nimpoverishment of the development of music to institute\na system of controls which demands that the composer\ntake his models from the past?\nThis seems to me not only very obvious but also\nsomething that we are able to find perhaps in this\ncountry, because here perhaps we will have a commission\nfor a piece of music and wo strive to please the person\nwho gives us the commission. But if in general we have\nfinal disagreement then we are free to try to obtain a\ncommission from some other person. Perhaps the\nsituation could be resolved into saying we donTt like\nto see a centralized control, from which there is no\nescape.\nYou bring up actually the whole question of how these\ncontrols operate in the Soviet Union, and I have often\nwondered exactly how a composer in the light of a\ncentralized control of this sort gets his work into\npublication and also into playing before the public,\n-more-"
