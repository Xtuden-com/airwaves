My illiterate moths r said: ”A nice\nlittle poem. A fellow with talent. He could describe\nour peasant’s life well. The people are suffering, oh,\nhow they are suffering.5’ These words inspired me and\nI immediately wrote my first poem about the sufferings\nof the peasants. In 1924, I went to the editorial\noffice of ’’Krasnaya Nov” and asked the editor: ”How\nabout me writing a sketch about peasant life for you?”\nHe said: ”Go ahead. Write one.” I then wrote a\nsketch. The sketch was published. A letter from Maxim\nGorky arrived. From Italy he wrote the editor: ”In\nyour magazine I enjoyed most the sketch of Rodion\nIvanov.” My heart beat with joy. My fate was sealed -\nto be a writer, to work in this field.\nIs there much difference in the average yearly earnings\nof various writers?"
