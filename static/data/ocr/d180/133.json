We spend the beginning of the\nnext month trying to undo the damage and get the\nmachines back in shape. But then it?s the end of\nthe month and the machines must go like crazy once\nmore. This cycle is murder. If you keep it up, sooner\nor later, the machines wear out or break.\nThe plan, man...the plan. I*m supposed to report\nfulfillment to Moscow every month. I can*t do it if\nyou*re drooling over those machines.\nBut can*t you see what happens? Instead of spending\na few hours doing preventive maintenance at the proper\ntime, we wind up spending days or weeks fixing broken\nmachines.\nWhy do you trouble yourself so? If we fulfill the\nplan, you*11 get your bonus.\nBonuses are fine. But I can*t satisfy an investigating\ncommission with a bonus. Don*t forget I*m responsible\nto the Ministry for these machines.\nAm I any less responsible not only for the machines\nbut for the whole factory?\nBut for how long? For all you know you may be transÂ¬\nferred tomorrow. I*ve been in this factory ten years\nand had seven directors. So I know directors come\nand go. But Druzhinin stays with the factory and the\nmachines.\nWhat do you want, a medal for having lived through so\nmany directors?\n(ANGRILY) There is a law. A law calling for a definite\nmaintenance schedule."
