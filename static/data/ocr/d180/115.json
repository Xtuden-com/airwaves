(CHANGED!.Y) Well, while ITm here IT11\ngive you the latest results on socialist competition\namong the shops. Allow me to say that while the\nresults have not been all we hoped for, yet considering\nthe fact that the workers are tired and that socialist\ncompetition is not too successful in a period of frantic\nall-out effort that verges on storming—\n(INTERRUPTING) We are not storming.\nI share your dislike and the party1s for the word, but\nthe facts are we are running men and machines night\nand day.\n(FIRMLY) We are engaged in a coordinated effort to\nmeet the plan. Now what about the production races\nbetween the shops?\nIt's going well especially in shops 3, $, and 12 but\nbut production is only up about 10$.\nNot enough. Remember, this is the last month and weTre\nbehind in production.\nIt could be improved if say....if Comrade Director was\nto... .double... .yes, double the prize for the winning\nshop.\nBaah! What kind of talk is this? Were the blast\nfurnaces of Magnitogorsk built with 10 per cents and\nprizes!?\n(SLYLY) Something is troubling you after all. Such\nemotion.\n(CALMING DOWN) All right. Double the prize."
