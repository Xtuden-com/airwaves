Samples have been provided to equipment man¬\nufacturers.\nTV TECHNICAL TIPS (August)\nA timely letter from Glen Southworth, staff engineer,\nat KWSC, Pullman, Washington, arrived to give us a\nlead item for this column. He writes of three recent\nTV developments for KWSC. These have proved\nuseful in practice, and he is preparing articles des¬\ncribing them to be submitted to technical publica¬\ntions. He has given advance information with per¬\nmission to use it in the Newsletter.\nPerhaps the most interesting of these devices is an\nelectronic pointer or framing device which can be used\nto locate significant material in slides, film clips or\npick-ups. The pointer circuitry generates the white\noutline of a rectangle of any size and dimensional re¬\nlationships, which may be located at any place on the\nraster. In addition, any or all the sides of the rec¬\ntangle may be removed. If desired, the vertical sides\nmay be “flexed” to attract attention; or a solid rect¬\nangle may be derived from the equipment which can\nbe used to key a montage amplifier or for other special\neffects. (See photo).\nA second device has been derived from the elec¬\ntronic pointer circuitry. This two-tube circuit per¬\nmits reproduction of oscilloscope traces over the TV\nsystem without need for any auxiliary equipment\nother than the signal source. The technique used is\nessentially limited to a 60 cps sweep rate, and re¬\nverses the X and Y scope axes on the TV screen. Mr.\nSouthworth thinks it should prove a very useful\ndevice in some applications. For instance, it is pos¬\nsible to convert a normal TV set into an oscilloscope\nthrough the use of this technique. By the use of an¬\nother tube in the circuit, it is possible to display two\ntraces simultaneously. In fact, he believes it is pos¬\nsible to display N traces by adding one tube per\ntrace. It is a very simple matter to super these traces\nover other program material. (See photo.)\nA third device, accomplished by simple circuitry,\nis a means of reducing normal picture information to\noutline form for animated supers. This process cer¬\ntainly has some interesting possibilities since it pro¬\nvides a means of reducing normal picture information\nto a pencil drawing or to a white outline which may\nbe supered over other picture information.\nMr. Southworth will be happy to correspond with\nanyone in NAEB who is interested in these or other\nspecial effects devices of a similar or related nature.\nIf you are interested in more detail, write to him in\ncare of KWSC, State College of Washington, Pullman,\nWash.\n* * * *\nWe have available a very practical eight-page\npaper on “Kinescope Recording,” written by Mr.\nSouthworth, which we are mailing to chief engineers\nof ETV stations and production centers. This paper\nwas written from his experience at the Army Signal\nCorps’ television center at Ft. Gordon, Georgia, where\nhis kinescope work covered a year’s time and some\nfifty TV shows. We have extra copies, which we will\nbe glad to send to others upon request.\n**. * *\nIn the mailing mentioned above, we are also send¬\ning a very fine booklet on “Television Signal Anal¬\nysis,” prepared by the American Telephone and Tele¬\ngraph Co. To quote from its introduction, “this book¬\nlet was written especially for telephone employees\nconcerned with the analysis of television signals\ntransmitted over AT&T facilities. Its principal\nobjective is to promote a common understanding of\nboth signal forms and their nomenclature.”\n2\nENGINEERING NEWSLETTER"
