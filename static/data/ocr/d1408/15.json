DEPARTMENT OF\nAGRICULTURE COOPERATING\nAMES, IOWA\nDear Friend:\nDuring the past few years radio stations have been used extensively\nin Iowa to carry agricultural information to rural families.\nThe Agricultural Extension Service is interested in improving the\nefficiency of radio broadcasting in reaching you with the best possible\nfarm information at the best time for your use in the day-by-day farm\njob. Since we do not know the answers to many of the questions\nconcerning farm broadcasting, your opinions on the use of radio will be\nvery helpful to us.\nPlease fill out the enclosed questionnaire which begins on the\nback of this letter. We realize that you are extremely busy these\ndays with spring work, but we hope that either you or some member of\nyour family will be able to find time to take a few minutes to check\nthe answers for the sixteen questions.\nSo that the information may be of the greatest value to us and\neventually to you, please return the questionnaire within the next ten\ndays. Use the enclosed, self-addressed envelope which requires no\npostage. Thank you.\nlours very truly,\nC. R. Elder\nExtension Editor\nP. S. If you do not own a radio, please return the questionnaire\nunanswered, using the self-addressed envelope.\n(over)"
