We hop©\nto train people to constructively criticise and to pass their opinions on\nto the producer®.\nSines we have a very active membership of about 30 people who represent\nteachers, parents, and radio end television personnel, we can reach a varied\naudience.\nWe were wondering if we could act as a reviewing body for radio programs\nwhich you might be considering for inclusion in your KAEB Network, We could\ninvite various teacher®8 organisations in the city to join us and thus get\na wider spread of opinion. Would such opinions be valuable to you?\nIf so - could ¥3 arrange a tim - when you could send us two or three pro¬\ngrams - plus evaluation forms - if you like?\nWe could then arrange a date with a rather large group - and play these\nprograms for them - get their opinion cad return the poll to you - with\nthe tapes,\nI spoke to you briefly about this at the Convention in Columbus this past\nApril - W© discussed it at our meeting this pest week and our msisbars would\ncertainly like to try such a plan,\n?ary sincerely youro,\n/&/ Virginia Edwards\nFreaidant-Sto Louis Chapter\nCopied at KAEB Hqs.
