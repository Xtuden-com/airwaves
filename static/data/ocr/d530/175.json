  "text": "48,\nthe exact future of the NAEB, it becomes increasingly clear that, if what\nappear to be fundamental services are to be maintained, the need for a\npermanent annual operational budget of something of the magnitude of the\npresent one ($150,000.00 or slightly more) must be faced, with special\ngrants from time to time for special projects. Some of this sum can be\nsecured on a self-liquidating or revolving fund basis, with fees and\ncharges carrying at least a portion of this load. A portion of this budget\nwill have to come from outside sources, however.\nFirmer predictions of a fiscal nature in this area can not be attempted\nby the present writer. An illustration of why is available in such in¬\nstances as these: during a single week last month, news of new jeopardies\nto at least three educational and community television stations plans was\nreceived, one of our member (FM) stations turned in its license, five\nstations cancelled their network memberships as fees were again raised,\nand two stations indicated doubt as to their ability to pay this new schedule\nof assessment fees. On such a base, completely firm predictions are im¬\npossible.\nNevertheless, it would appear that just as education generally is not\nself-supporting and educational broadcasting will always need outside support,\nas a legitimate educational expense, so will the association of educational\nbroadcasters, for the foreseeable future. The financial status of all but\na very small number of members is too insecure at the moment to expect them\nto increase their share of the financial burden of the expenses of the NAEB\nmuch farther than is now scheduled. Rather it is likely that during at least\nthe next four or five years many members will need to rely even more heavily\non the Association, if the storms buffeting plans for an adequate educational\nbroadcasting service are not to sweep it away."
