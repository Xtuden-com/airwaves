  "text": "49,\nAs will be found as a positive statement of this writer in Exhibit 41\nit seems to us essential that educational television be considered as a\nlegitimate regular curricular expense and tool, as definitely budgetable as\nteachers’ salaries, books, paper, electricity, or any other expense, in the\nscheme of American education. The fact that this status was never achieved for\nradio should not deter us in our efforts on behalf of workers and budgets for\nboth. This will be one of the NAEB’s objectives, at least, for the next several\nyears; to advance this philosophy wherever and whenever possible.\nIn view of the ”crisis at the crossroads” which now prevails in educa¬\ntion as well as in educational television, foundation support for the NAEB\nand projects to further educational broadcasting is expected to be necessary\nfor some time, on a considerable scale. It is not felt that any apology\nshould be necessary for the fact that the NAEB, as a responsible educational\nforce, will continue to place the legitimacy of educational needs ahead of\nthe question of whether or not an individual project can be made self-\nsupporting. If the NAEB did not take this view, it might as well retreat\nfrom the communications area and leave it to commercial groups in which\nself-support is a primary consideration. And if America is to have a truly\nalternative or supplementary television and radio service, it is not believed\nlikely that this will be allowed to occur.\nThe NAEB therefore is both confident and respectful of the future, and\nproud of its last few years and months as it respectfully submits this report\nand expresses, once again, its sincere appreciation for the support and tire¬\nless understanding of the Fund for Adult Education.\nRespectfully submitted on behalf of\nPresident Graydon Ausmus and the\nNAEB Board of Directors\n■h ' jf\nH. J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nSeptember 20, 1954\nUrbana, Illinois"
