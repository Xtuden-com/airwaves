  "text": "35.\ncasters, National Citizens Committee on Educational Television, and the Joint\nCommittee on Educational Television were written to introduce the new service\nand to find out if they were still looking for new positions. The response was\ngratifying. Approximately 200 persons submitted letters of application. Mean¬\nwhile our member stations were circularized with a- statement that we were\nofficially opened and that we would be glad to be of service at the first\npossible opportunity.\nApplications started coming in at a rapid rate from the very beginning. Pro¬\nducer-director applicants are in the majority, while technical applicants such as\nvideo operators, engineers, etc. are lacking. The educational broadcasting\nstations which have positions open are slowly but surely coming to the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters Placement Service for personnel needs.\nApplications range from men and women with a great deal of education and\nexperience to the novice just out of trade school or college with very little\nif any experience. Some of them ask advice on how to apply, where to attend\nschool, what the salary ranges are and what part of the country is the most\nreceptive to educational broadcasting.\nIn the beginning, the applicants were asked to submit a data sheet so that\nthe Placement Service could have information about them in its main file.\nLater, after analysis of the data sheets submitted, a trip to various Chicago\nemployment agencies was made by Mr. Walker. With the information received from\nthe data sheets, the Chicago trip, and facilities of the University of Illinois\nLibrary, Mr. Walker devised a set of permanent forms for the Placement Service.\nAlthough the final results of these forms are yet to be tabulated, there\nseems to be a minimum of errors. Small ’’bugs’1 as are found in new model cars\nor airplanes have been found, but in general, the forms are standing up well."
