  "text": "36.\nSome educational stations have asked the Placement Service about job\nclassifications, analysis, duties, wages, etc. All these questions from both\nprospective employers and employees have had to be answered rather vaguely so\nfar. The future of the Educational Television and Radio Placement Service seems\nbright; and it is traveling in the right direction from all indications, but\nthere still is not enough experience behind this type of agency to justify any\ndefinite answers. The Placement Service has not been ”in business” long enough\nto gather significant statistics.\nAt the present time, there are approximately 350 persons,looking for new\npositions in educational broadcasting,listed With the new NAEB Placement Service.\nIt is difficult to say how many persons have so far been placed in educational\nbroadcasting through us. Although attempts have been made to keep track of the\npositions filled through Placement Service, the results of our placement some¬\ntimes do not reach our office until the position has been filled for several\nweeks. Forms have been devised to take care of this need, but it will still be\nseveral months before we will be able to count upon full cooperation from all\nstations and applicants to report to us the outcome and details concerning their\nemployment.\nThe Placement Service has on file many letters congratulating and sincerely\ncommending the Fund for Adult Education and the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters for instituting a Placement Service which has con¬\nsolidated the placement and personnel classification functions which were\nhandled formerly by a variety of organizations. Morale among the applicants\nis beginning to be better because instead of having to file in many locations,\nand checking with various agencies, and stations, they can accomplish the same\nmeans by filling out the Placement Service’s forms."
