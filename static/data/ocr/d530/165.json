In some, labor was not represented at all.\nIn most, labor was not adequately represented to give it generally a proprietary\ninterest so that unions would speak for these television stations, as a part of\nthem, rather than as outsiders coming to the station as the source of funds or\nbenefits. In our opinion the prompt steps taken in most communities to correct\nthis situation, once it was adequately explained by Mr. Novik, are the most\nsignificant results of his work so far.\nAnother achievement, second only to the above, was securing recognition of\neducational television’s need for a special status, quite different from that of\ncommercial television. This recognition had to be achieved promptly at the\nnational level in time for this national philosophy to help take the pressure\noff in local areas like St. Louis, where local chapters of the IBEW and IATSE\nparticularly appeared likely to insist on conditions which\n1) would seriously cripple the educational or community\ntelevision station financially, and\n2) might set a dangerous precedent nationally.\nThe fact that this recognition was achieved, and was brought about soon enough\nto secure far more advantageous contracts in St. Louis than it was at first\nfeared, is extremely gratifying. Quoting from Mr. Novik»s report on the St. Louis\nsituation:\n’*It seemed to me that the best way to solve the St. Louis problem was to try\nto get recognition on a national level by IBEW and IATSE of the special con¬\nsideration due non-commercial, educational television stations. After many\nprivate discussions the national leadership of IBEW and IATSE formally adopted\nthat policy, with local contracts to be negotiated on the local level. That,\nit seemed to me, accomplished the overall objective we were seeking and gave the\nprotection that some of the local groups wanted.”"
