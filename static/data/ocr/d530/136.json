Adult Education MBig Four\" Project\nAlthough this brief mention does not pretend to the status of a report on\nthe Big Four NAEB Adult Education Committee project for which Hr. Ralph Lowell\nhandled the funds, any summary statement on FAE-NAEB relations would be incom¬\nplete if some reference thereto were not included. A complete published report\non this project, as prepared by Mr. George Probst, is understood to be near com¬\npletion, and will be forwarded soon.\nMeanwhile the perspective which the intervening years have given on this\nproject confirms its success as an example in revealing what educational broad¬\ncasting could do if adequate funds were available. The evaluations of some or\nall these series by Test Cities Discussion Groups, and by broadcasters and edu¬\ncators, are well known. Voices of Europe finally ran to 65 programs, ending\nFebruary 13* There have been many imitations since then, and the NAEB this\npast year was itself able to offer a similar’ series:' Asia Reports, financed\nlargely By the National Copnittee for a Free’Asia and Radio Free Asia. It was\ncarried by 65 stations, and received many complimentary notices.\nWays of Mankind I and II have won all conceivable awards, and a total of\n472 albums, including free copies for various nations unable to pay, have been\ndistributed around the world so far, with the demand still growing. The Beacon\nPress edition of the scripts of the first series are now also available. The\nPrix Italia Jury last year was also deeply impressed by this great series.\nThe Jeffersonian Heritage has become perhaps the best-known set of radio\nor recorded programs in the world on the meaning, in understandable form, of\ndemocracy, liberalism and the American way of life. 331 albums, and 3953\nbooks of scripts for this series have already been distributed."
