This is a tribute to the importance of the general area in which founda¬\ntion support has been given, as well as to the energy of the NAEB in opening it\nup. If support for considerably longer than was originally considered necessary\nnow must be sought, it is not a result of failure, but of success.\nAlso there have been many distractions and competing events to retard the\ndevelopment of that public sentiment and understanding which must exist before\neducational broadcasting can exist without foundation assistance. Organizations\nbesides the NAEB have found the past three years full of energetic, uncontroll¬\nable forces, as well as distractions and surprises. It is these forces, and the\nneed to develop understanding and controls for them, that makes the NAEB believe\nthat its role will continue to be an increasingly essential one in both the\nAmerican and the world*s education and communications picture."
