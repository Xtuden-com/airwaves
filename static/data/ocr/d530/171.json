Grants-in-Aid\nFor three years the NAEB, with funds provided by the Fund for Adult Educa¬\ntion (for the last two years through the ETRC), has been making Grants-in-Aid\nto educational radio and television stations to enable them to produce outstand¬\ning content-oriented programs. These programs are subsequently carried on\neducational stations throughout the country through the facilities of the NAEB\nNetwork and the ETRC. During the first two years (1952-53 and 1953-54) a total\nof $67,300.00* was granted to 15 radio stations for programs totalling 84 hours\nand 30 minutes of program time, (in addition, there are still several series of\nprograms to be submitted by the University of Chicago for consideration by the\nNetwork Acceptance Committee.) The grants for television programs totalled\n$87,500.00* for the same period. Television grants were made to 12 institutions\nfor a total of 82 hours and 15 minutes of programming. The radio programs\nresulting from the 1952-53 grants have been carried by an average of 67 stations\non the NAEB Network. Most of the programs from the 1953-54 grants are now being\nprocessed by the Network Acceptance Committee, and a report will not be available\nuntil later.
