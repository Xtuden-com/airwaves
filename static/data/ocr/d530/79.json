For if educational stations begin to Rride the network\"...if,\nfrom th® resources of ideas in educational institutions, educational radio and\ntelevision do not produce significantly new types of programs and open up new\nAreas of learning and -services to the public, th© dream and promise of those who\nrequested channels for educational television, as well as for FM, are not being\nrealised or kept.\nFacilities for kinescopes and other production work are desperately\nneeded in various important geographical areas, like Washington, D. C., or the\nHarvard, lale, and Princeton areas,where little is now to be found. It is believed\nthat FAE support is makix^ kinescope facilities likely to be available on a more\nadequate basis than radio facilities. But in eom cases radio may be vastly more\npractical and economical. Both need to be remembered in any approaches to founda¬\ntions for funds.\n(One of the greatest needs of the MSB Radio Metwork has been for at\nleast weekly reports fro®. Washington, reports of a background sort not now avail¬\nable. All efforts to secure these have floundered on the absence of educational\nfacilities or adequate staffs to provide this service on an economical base. It\nis hoped that some combination uses or facilities may be worked out for both radio\n&qd television. Wherevsr on® of the two may got a foot in the door, the other\nshould have access, even if only on an understandably limited basis. Local\nassistance can probably sometimes be onlisted for ouch combined facilities.)\nIfodals of quality programming oaa best be provided if quality rather than\nquantity can become the point of emphasis for each station. Th© Importance of a\nnetwork center and exchange facilities in mich an arrangement is obvious."
