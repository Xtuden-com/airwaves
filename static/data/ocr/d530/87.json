(This assumes leaving to the ETRG the National program costs\nmentioned under comments to question 5, If the HAEB should be oalled upon to assume\na larger share of the responsibility for collecting and distributing television pro¬\ngrams, the sum here mentioned would of course have to be increased.) Up to perhaps\none-third of this sum can perhaps be provided by the membership. A certain propor¬\ntion of the rest can be provided by charging for various services and publications.\nThe remainder, probably something in the neighborhood of one hundred fifty to two\nhundred thousand dollars per year, for the foreseeable future, will continue to need\noutside support as the NA£B takes over the providing of the more and more services\nwhich educational television stations, as well as radio stations, request.\nThe history of the HAEB* the use it has made of Foundation support in the\npast, and the traditional economy of its entire operations would seem to make it the\nsort of association which can subsist and operate•with as modest outside assistance\nas any whioh might be devised.\nWorking closely as it has from the beginning with the ETRG and other groups\nto insure understanding and support among educators, adequate utilization, adequate\nproduction standards, and sound financing, its foundations are in the grass roots\nand school systems of America, from which it hopes to draw increasingly sound educa¬\ntional values. For it is education which must be our first concern* not our respec¬\ntive organizations, or even radio or television except as a part of education.\nOn behalf of the NAEB as authorized by the\nDirectors and approved by President Graydon\nVcmaA\nHarry Jfj Sfcforaia\nExecutive Director\nJuly 30, 1954"
