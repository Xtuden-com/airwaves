  "text": "-2-\nA preliminary report was presented which approved, among others, the de¬\ncision of the University to file an application for an FM broadcasting license\nwith the FCC. Assuming that this application will be granted and that, within\na year, the University will be operating such a station, the University Commit¬\ntee on Radio now seeks to formulate, \"in perhaps tentative terms\" and in line\nwith the President’s request, certain basic principles of policy for the guid¬\nance of the University Radio Program and, more particularly, the University\nRadio Station.\nII. The University and Radio\nIn addition to its specific functions as an educational institution,\nnamely, the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, a University in a iree\nsociety has another role. This is the general duty — indeed, even, responsi¬\nbility -- of aiding in informing public opinion so that proper and wise decisions\nmay be made by the people in the direction of their own affairs and in the shap¬\ning of public policy.\nFirst and foremost, therefore, the University's Radio Station is to be\nregarded as a pub lie-service agency serving the American people and more spe¬\ncifically the region in which it will operate. Its activities will be consonant\nwith the best traditions of a free society and will follow the paths of educa¬\ntional and cultural endeavor which the University itself has blazed over a long\nperiod.\nThe University Radio Station, therefore, will be free of partisanship or\nspecial pleading in the sense that the University's classrooms, lecture plat¬\nforms, scientific laboratories and learned journals are free. The University\nis a fellowship of responsible and mature scholars and educators who seek only\nthe ascertainment of the nature of truth and its dissemination for the public\nwelfare. The University Radio Station, as a part of the University, will be\nconducted in the same spirit*"
