Paulu, Resident\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nRadio Station KUOH\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis lb, Minnesota\nDear Burton*\nThank you for your letter of September 6 and for your kind comments«\nYou will recall that you asked if I would want to appear before the\nBoard at St. Louis to present the Neilsen proposal. Since Irving\nMerrill is so close to this and has worked on the matter for several\nyears, I am going to ask him to prepare the one or two page summary\nof the basic facts and arguments concerned. I feel that this shouldn’t\nbe a word-of-mouth deal and that it would be best to have Irv. there\ninstead to answer in detail any of the questions of the Board.\nThe Committee has already requested him to follow through on the\nmatter and it is only logical to have this completed under his capable\nsupervision.\nHarry has forwarded about fifty letters nominating various partici¬\npants to the Seminar. I’ll start on this mass of material and see\nif we can’t get it condensed to some sort of workable form.\nCordially,\nRaymond D. Cheydleur, Chairman\nResearch Committee\nRBCjas\nc.c. Irving Merrill\nHarry Skornia\nairmail"
