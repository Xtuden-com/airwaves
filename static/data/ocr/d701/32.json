NIELSEN COMPANY\n2101 Howard Street\nChicago U5, Illinois\nHOLLYCOURT 5-1^00\nAugust 19, 1957\nMr. Irving Merrill\nDirector of Television Research\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan\nDear Mr. Merrills\nThe separate sheet enclosed lists station members of your\nAssociation for which NCS No. 2 has already compiled and\nreleased station coverage data. You will note that there\nare only twenty-four stations falling into this class¬\nification.\nBy way of explanation, our minimum reporting standards re¬\nquire listening or viewing by at least IQ$ of all families\nin a county, sometime within a month. From a commercial\npoint of view this is a low activity level, but when these\nsame standards are applied to educational broadcasting, it\nis obvious that relatively few stations have audiences of\nthis size.\nIn checking over your membership list, it becomes apparent\nthat the majority of your stations are FM. NCS asked for\nthe inclusion of PM in gathering station listening data\nfrom the respondents, but here again, the 10$ minimum re¬\nporting cut-off level almost automatically excludes FM\nfrom our reporting.\nIn June of 1957, we conducted a very detailed study of FM\nreceiver ownership and use for a continuous two-month period.\nUsing our measurement panel of homes in which we meter all\nset activity and in which we maintain an up-to-date inventory\nof their receivers, we found that only 1of the homes had\nan FM receiver of any type. In 15$ of these FM homes, the\nreceivers were out of order for the entire measurement period.\nIn an additional 56$ of the FM homes, the FM band was not used\nat all during this time span. Thus, only 29$ of the FM Homes\ndid any FM listening. These listeners averaged only 25 minutes\na day, including those that listened several hours down to\nthose that listened one minute or more. By contrast, the\naverage AM receiver home listened a little more than two hours\nper day."
