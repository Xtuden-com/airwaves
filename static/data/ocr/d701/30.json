Cheydleur\nFlorida State University\nTallahassee, Florida\nDear Bay:\nThank yon very much for your kind hope that I might be Chairman of the\nResearch Committee next year. Believe me, I hope equally fervently that\nyou will be able to maintain your chairmanship because I think you have\ndone a splendid job.\nI am enclosing a copy of the list of participants sent to Qfyler.\nI will be hapiy to prepare the one or two page summary on our NCS #2\nproposal. I have decided to write Nielsen telling them the sum of\n^ $4,?00 is beyond our capacity and suggesting some other bases for\ncomputation v/hich might result in a sum which is more realistic. This\nwill mean that there will be available for the Board at the St. Louis\nmeeting the following:\n(a) a two page summary of the Nielsen Study and its\nadvantages for the NAEB\n(b) an offer from Nielsen more nearly in line with\nwhat we can arrange to pay.\nI will ship the above information to whoever makes the presentation\nbefore the Board. I appreciate your suggestion that I make such a\npresentation. It would help in arranging travel pay if some more formal\nrequest for my presence were available. I was wondering if this should\ncome from you or from Harry. It makes no difference at this end of the\nline which one of you signs.\nSincerely,\nIrving B. Merrill\nDirector of Television Research\nIBM/cdm\n1 end."
