Either we do or don’t cover\nthe same ground; in either case, our decision should be deliberately\nrather than accidentally taken.\nThere also is the research being carried out by the ETRC.\nWhat findings is it producing? What is our relationship to it?\nWhat about the studies being conducted in connection with the\nHagerstown projects? They toyo are appraising their work as they go.\nAs to the personnel participating in our meeting, I shall\nnot pass upon the qualifications of those people with whom we are\nwell acquainted. I think it is desirable, however, to include in\nthis group, not only some of our own members, but also people Active\nin other fields. I see that Ry C$Lary nominates Dr. Arthur Wells\nPoshay. Wells was one of the members of the Washington meeting who\nmost impressed me. He is oriented in non-broadcast areas, and yet is\ntemperamentally and intellectually equipped to bridge their points\nof view and ours. I therefore should recommend very strongly that\nhe be invited. Another good//i»esource person would be Charles\nHoban, Project Director, Human Factors Study Center, Institute for\nCooperative Research, University of Pennsylvania. He too was at\nthe DAVI meeting in Washington.\nI also should like to say a word for Dr. William A. Mindak\nfrom the University of Minnesota. I think well of him; he too\ncould make a good contribution. He is currently, as you know,\nworking on the ETRC study relative to the attitudes of the\ntowards KTCA-TV in the Twin Cities.\nWell, Ray, take or leave these suggestions. But in any\ncase, I am very enthusiastic about this meeting. We should hear\nabout it at the convention, both in the Board meeting and general\nsessions, so that our members will be aware of the good work you\nand your committee are doing.\nBP:ds\npublic x\n■w"
