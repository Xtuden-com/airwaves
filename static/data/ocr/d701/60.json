We recognise, however, that most of\nour information about all of them is very incomplete. We are therefore vitally\ninterested in whatever research your group may undertake which will prove of\nvalue to VnV and to educational television everywhere.\nI will be happy to be of whatever help I can be to your Research Seminar\nin furthering these objectives.\nSincerely,\nChalmers Marquis\nProgram Development\nCMten"
