Kielsen Company\n2101 Howard Street\nChicago 45, Illinois\nDear Mr, Churchill t\nthank you very much for your letter of August 19. You will be interested\nto know that 2 prepared a report to the ether members of the Research\nCommittee recommending that favorable action be taken toward the purchase\nof the complete packa^a of reports in the form normally available to\nadvertising agencies.\nSeveral days ago l received a reply from Dr, Skornia, Executive Director\nof the Association, indicating there is considerable Interest among the\nOfficers In securing this Study. However, 1 must be frank and report\nthat Dr. Skornia says it would be impossible for us to pay anywhere near\nthe $4,700 which Is the standard rate for a profit making advertising\nagency. He adds that he has only available at present about $1,000\nfor this purpose.\nMay 2 offer the following suggestion? If we can find some reasonable basis\nupon which to negotiate a salt at a lower cost. Dr. Skornia and 1 would bo\nglad to visit your offices and try to reach an agreement which we could\npresent for approval to our Board of Directors which meets in St. Louis\nduring October.\nFive years ago no one In the VAS3 would hare for a moment coneidared the\npossibility of a purchase in the amount we are discussing today. Five\nyears from now it Is nuite possible that our Association will bs soma\nkind of regular cuetomsr of the Nielsen Company not only for coverage\ndata but also for ratings. May I suggest this agreement mi^ht well bo\nlooked upon as a \"pump priming\" venture on the part of the Nielsen Company.\nthere seems to me to be some justification for the Nisi sen Company to\nsupply NCS #2 on an at/below cost basis as an educational donation as the\nAssociation consists entirely of stations operated by educational or civic\ninstitutions on a non-commercial basis."
