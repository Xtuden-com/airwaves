We have no one at WTTW specifically titled Research\nDirector. However, I have been responsible here for coordinating\nthe research which affects our programming; I sn moat interested,\ntherefore, in the work of your group.\nMy previous experience after leaving Gregory Hall with a\nJournalism B.S. some years ago, has been concerned for the past\n8 years with talevision production, commercial until Joining WTTW\n2 years ago. And because a producer must oertalnly keep at least\none eye and ear toward his audiences, I have naturally been con¬\ncerned with TV audience and programming research.\nMy own research concerns here at WTTW have been in several\nareas. We have sponsored three atudies in cooperation with North¬\nwestern Universityi (1) an analysis of audience mail, (2) a mail\nquestionnaire survey of WTTW donors, and (3) • broad interview\nproject measuring WTTW penetration into the community. I also\nsunmariie to our staff and for our staff and for our publications\nreports of our three Chicago area professional TV audience surveys\nand ratings, as well as the ETRC research projects.\n\\\nWe at WTTW feel the need for much more information about the\n'audiences and programs with which we work. We would specifically\nbe interested in these areast\n1. What motivates particular educational television program\nviewing by individual*?\n2. What can be found out quantitatively as well as qualitatively\nabout total audiences for ETRC progrsms?\n3.\nWhat motivates community organisation participation in\nhelping to produce educational television programs?\nRaiary ctMa.a\n**•■» X talar Catlap\nUmnoMjr at CkM^R\nL—aaraHy at IHiaaM\n■"
