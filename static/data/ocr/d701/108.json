I believe you, as well as the rest of\nthe committee, are familiar with my qualifications, so perhaps\nI do not need to elaborate. Specifically, so far as research\nis concerned, our station has conducted surveys on a limited\nbasis from time to time, and while they are uaually done by\nmembers of our staff, I am in the position to direct them. I\nam intensely Interested in this problem and I believe that it\nla important to all NAEB stations. One of the questions which\nI usually comes up concerns the educational broadcasting stations*\nj services to the majority of listeners or to a minority group.\nI would like to see this question discussed.\nIf there Is any data you need please let me know.\n81ncerely,\nCarl H.
