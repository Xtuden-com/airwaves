I think the nose-counting surveys\ncould be left to the individual stations. But that which\npenetrates more deeply into the way in which people react\nor can be persuaded to react probably is too costly to be\nconducted by any one Institution. In any event, I believe\nthat facts of this kind which are obtained should be\navailable to all Institutions.\nCordially yours.\nAM:nd\nAllen Miller\nStation Manager"
