Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNAEB HEA09UARTER8\n14 Gresort Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nIn answer to your memo of August 9th.\n1. Dr. Warren F. Seisert is the TV program\nResearch Consultant for Purouc. His\nTRAINING CONSISTS OF THE BACHELORS IN EO-\nUC A TION, THE MASTERS IN EDUCATION (MAJOR\nIN Guioance AND COUNSELL I ns), Ph.O. IN\nPsychology (major in Industrial, minors\nIN GUIOANCE AND IN SENERAL-EXPERI ME NT AL\nPSYCHOLOGY ).\n2. Dr. Seibert suggests as a starter: I) the\nPROBLEM OF INTEGRATING RESEARCH FINDINGS —\nTHE ’•FRAMEWORK'* INTO WHICH RESULTS MAY BE\nFITTED AND FROM WHICH TESTABLE HYPOTHESES\nMAY BE DRAWN. 2) I WOULD LIKE TS HEAR OTHERS'\nIOEAS CONCERNING THE SELECTION PROCEDURES\nTO BE USED IN CHOOSING ETV \"TALENT*. 3) I\nBELIEVE THAT TV STUDENT RETENTION OVER PRO-\nTACTED PERIODS OF TIME NEEDS INVESTIGATION\n(small joke). We have hopes that our Cal¬\nculus GROUP MAY SERVE AS A \"GUINEA PISw\nsample for one stuoy of this sort. 4) I\nHAVE BEEN WO NOERING WHAT CRITERIA, IF ANY,\nWILL SHOW GREATEST TV VS. CONVENTIONAL 0 IF-\nFERENCES. WE KNOW THAT THE CUSTOMARY CRITERIA\nREVEAL LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO\nSEPARATELY TAUGHT GROUPS, YET MANY INSIST THAT\nDIFFERENCES EXIST — PERHAPS THEY OO. IF\nOTHERS HAVE I0EA8 CONCERNING THE DIFFERENCES\nAND THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, THESE\nSHOULD 6 E VALUABLE. IF RESEARCH SEARS 01\nBEARS OUT\n»\n~f WBAA<»\"»"
