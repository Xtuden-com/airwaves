Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall \" \" - 1 •' -r \"*J ^ I\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Jlarry;\nIn response to your communication of an earlier date\nconcerning needed data for research seminar, I wish to submit tne\nfollowing information. Mr: James W. Case, Program Director for\nKHMA TV, is responsible lor all research concerning KRMA-TV. I\nwould recommend that Mr. C~ae be consulted concerning any problems\nof research.\nWe have two research projects now in progress at KRMA-TV,\nnamely; (l) public opinion survey in determining television viewing !\nhabits in the city of Denver with particular reference to the viewer-\nship of KRMA-TV, and (2) television effectiveness of French instruction.\nThe actual research for KRMA-TV has been and will be done\nby Research Services Incorporated of Denver, Colorado (a comeercial\nfirm) and the Department of Research of the Denver Public Schools.\nWe would recommend that the problem to be discussed in the\nseminar mignt be direcred toward a definite 'pinpointing'’ of research\non the national level. It appears that too many research projects\nare now being made which has a tendency to confuse those of us in the\neducational television area.\nI would greatly appreciate having Mr. James Case represent\nus at this research seminar if possible.\nMay I also take this opportunity to extend to you my congratu¬\nlations upon a very successful Management Seminar neld in Monticello\nduring the past month. I felt tnat it was extremely worthwhile and\ngreat progress was made.\nVery sincerely yours.\nHoward L. Johnson\nHU:vt Executive Director\ncc: Mr. James Case"
