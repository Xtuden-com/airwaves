In Iowa, WOI\ntook first place in competition with several excel¬\nlent independent and chain stations. This sta¬\ntion is making every effort to keep equipment and\nprogram fully abreast of the times.\n4 6 Super-Power\"\nIowa State College was actively engaged in the\nradio field for many years before the advent of\ncommercial broadcasting. The Electrical Engi¬\nneering Department, under Professor F. A. Fish,\nmaintained a highly efficient amateur station\noperating under the call letters 9Y1. This sta¬\ntion was in operation prior to 1914. The 240\ncycle note of the synchronous spark transmitter\nwas well known throughout the Middlewest be¬\nfore the beginning of voice transmission.\nWhen the practicability of broadcasting was\ndemonstrated, the Department began work on a\n50-watt “super-power” outfit, which was later in¬\ncreased to 100 watts. With this power the trans¬\nmitter first went on the air the evening of Novem¬\nber 21, 1921. In April, 1922, the call WOI was\nassigned to the station.\nConstant expansion brought a demand for ad¬\nditional room and power. By 1925 WOI had far\noutgrown its original function as an experiment\nof the Electrical Engineering Department. The\nstation was reorganized as a part of the Iowa State\nCollege and operated from funds supplied by the\nAgricultural Extension Service and from general\nCollege funds. In 1926 the entire station was\nplaced under the direction of Professor W. I.\nGriffith.\nStaff\nThe staff consists of 12 members; four are full¬\ntime workers, two are part-time workers and six\nare student workers.\nA. G. Woolfries, announcer of WOI, has been with the station\nsince it first began operation in 1922."
