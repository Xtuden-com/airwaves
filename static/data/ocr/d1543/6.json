Bars educational broadcasters from making a single copy of an\nentire work or multiple copies of an excerpt or quotation from a\nwork, for instructional purposes, a prohibition which largely:\na. Prevents recording or pre-recordingof programs for\ndelayed broadcast purposes (on open or closed circuit).\nb.

Prevents stations from serving schools effectively via\nrepeat transmissions for accommodation of varied\nschedules.\ne. Destroys the economic benefits which ETV can provide\nthrough development and exchange of high quality\ncourses pre-recorded on video tape for repeated use\nover several years’ time.\nf. Prevents the preservation of outstanding programs for\nrebroadcast, study or archival purposes.\ng. Requires tailoring of broadcast schedules to the\navailability of program participants rather than the\nneeds of students.\nSection 6 (Fair Use)\nSubstitutes for the present unwritten, judicially instituted and interpreted\ndoctrine of “fair use”, a written definition which may be narrower and\nmore limiting to education than the present application of “fair use.”\nThis proposed section:"
