HARLEY\nPRESIDENT\nJanuary 13, 1965\nTO NAEB INSTITUTIONAL MEMBERS\nIn revising our over-all publications program, the deter¬\nmination was made to turn over to the Divisions the respon¬\nsibility for reprinting news of the latest developments in\nWashington affecting the various areas of educational broad¬\ncasting. Hereafter the Washington Report will be devoted\nto win-depthM reports of general interest to the membership.\nOn the important issue of community antenna television\nregulation, we are pleased to inaugurate our new Washington\nReport with a paper by the NAEB General Counsel, Norman\nJorgensen.\nMr. Jorgensen's paper is based on a study of the comments\nthat parties have made before the Federal Communications\nCommission and concludes with some general recommendations\nparticularly oriented toward educational television stations.\nThe development of wired systems that serve as adjuncts to\nbroadcast facilities is already a part of the service pro¬\nvided to the public. While it has been related to educational\ntelevision, there are no technical reasons why educational\nradio stations could not be included. Although such\npossibilities may appear remote at this time, we are including\nmembers of NER in this mailing so that all of the NAEB\nInstitutional Division will be informed of current status\nof comments before the Commission.\nOn December 9, a meeting between NAEB/ETS officials and the\neducational television committee of the National Community\nTelevision Association established the need for close contact\nbetween the two groups in order to minimize conflicting\npositions. We shall undoubtedly be sending you further\nreports.\n-W.G. Harley"
