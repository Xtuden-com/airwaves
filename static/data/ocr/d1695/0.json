AUGUSTA BLVD., CHICAGO 51, ILLINOIS\nInstitutions located reasonably close to television stations can gen¬\nerally rely upon antennas usually built into the receivers to provide\nadequate signal strength pickup. In some instances it may be neces¬\nsary to substitute a higher-gain indoor antenna, placed on top of the\nset. Where this latter does not suffice, and where more than a\nsingle television set is to be used in a building, a master antenna\nsystem provides the best solution.\nErecting an outdoor antenna for each television receiver in use in a\nsingle structure is impractical too for several reasons. It results in\na maze of masts, guy wires, and lead-ins; a fire hazard, as well as\nan eyesore. Roof space adequate for separate installations is usually\nnot available. TV sets sometimes transmit signals of their own from\ntheir antennas that can seriously interfere with other receivers hav¬\ning their antennas nearby. And since not all rooftop positions are\nequally effective as antenna locations, reception on some sets would\nbe poorer than others. For these and other good reasons new build¬\ning projects should provide for utilization of a master antenna.\nPlans should include specifications for a coaxial cable conduit sys¬\ntem, with outlets in each classroom, auditorium, study hall, or\nother room where it is reasonable to expect televiewing activities.\nStudents Erecting\nOutdoor Antenna\nas a Do-It-Yourself\nProject"
