  "text": "RUSSIAN OFFERED ON TV\nWhat is believed to be the nation’s first televised\ncourse in the Russian language has been announced\nby General Electric station WRGB, cooperating with\nthe Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Tele¬\nvision and the local section of the American Chemi¬\ncal Society, in a pioneer move to help crack a major\ntechnological problem.\nThe problem: The United States is receiving much\ntechnical literature from Russia, but a great deal is\nignored because only a few of our engineers and\nscientists understand the language. Some scientists,\nfor instance, believe that the first Sputnik may not\nhave been such a big surprise had more Americans\nbeen able to read Russian.\nOccupying an early spot from 6:30 to 7 a.m., the\n12-week series will reach a potential audience of more\nthan one million upstate New Yorkers. It will start\nFeb. 4.\nRECOMMENDED READING\nThe 12th edition of the World Radio Handbook, an\nannual publication by O. Lund Johansen of Copen¬\nhagen, Denmark, is a valuable reference work for\neveryone concerned with radio or TV broadcasting.\nThe 175-page, illustrated publication contains in¬\nformation On broadcasting activities throughout the\nworld. It also features a worldwide “Who’s Who” in\nbroadcasting under which prominent personalities\nand organizations in the field are listed'. (The NAEB\nis listed on page 123.)\nThe price of a single copy is 20 cents. Interested\npersons can order through writing to World Radio\nHandbook, 1 Lindorffsalle, Hellerup, Denmark.\nN. M. ETV STATION GETS\n4 SETS OF CALL LETTERS\nNot one but four sets of call letters have been as¬\nsigned to the new educational TV station, Channel\n5, owned and operated by the University of New\nMexico and the Albuquerque Public Schools.\nThe letters that the viewing public will know are\nKNME-TV-the K denoting the western part of the\nUnited States and the NME-TV standing for New\nMexico Educational Television. These call letters\noriginally were assigned to the schooner Albert D.\nCummins, but were removed from registry in 1937.\nNonetheless, they had to be released by the Bureau\n^ of Customs before they could’ be assigned to the new\nstation.\nThe other three sets of call letters are KKT-911,\ncall letters from the studio to the Sandia Crest trans¬\nmitter site; KKU-322, Crest call letters back to the\nstudio; and KOG-34, call letters of the studio to\ntransmitter link.\nDr. Bernarr Cooper, radio and TV director at the\nUniversity UNM hopes that the station will go on\nthe air shortly after the beginning of the second\nsemester.\nGREATER ACCEPTANCE OF TV SEEN\nPublic acceptance of TV was mirrored in a report by\nDr. Paul Witty, professor of education at North¬\nwestern University, on a continuing eight-year\nstudy of the reactions to TV of elementary and high\nschool pupils, their teachers and parents.\n“There has been a marked change in the attitude\ntoward TV on the part of many parents and\nteachers,” Dr. Witty said in a report to the Ameri¬\ncan Assn, for the Advancement of Science.\n“At first, large numbers were skeptical concerning\nany desirable outcome from TV. Today,” he added,\n“more parents and teachers accept televiewing as a\npart of our design of living. They cite problems less\nfrequently and indicate that children actually\nappear to read more because of interests awakened\nby TV offerings.”\nWitty also said, “Let us cease to attribute to TV\nmisdemeanors in children and youth. Let us instead\ntry to gain the greatest values from this appealing\nmedium ... by guiding children to choose programs\nwith greater discrimination and by associating this\nstrong interest with other desirable activities.”\nTV TECHNICAL TIPS\n— Cecil S. Bidlack\nOn Jan. 15, I had the privilege of attending a dem¬\nonstration of the new RCA color video tape re¬\ncorder in Camden, N. J. More than 100 broadcasters\nand engineers attended the afternoon demonstration\nincluding Fred Remley and Larry Griewski of the\nUniversity of Michigan, Dr. W. J. Kessler of the Uni¬\nversity of Florida, Cy Braum of JCET and the writer.\nWe saw Art Hungerford in the group attending the\nmorning demonstration and there may have been\nother ETV representatives we missed seeing.\nWe were very much impressed by the performance\nof the equipment. Some observers thought the quality\nof the recordings as good as live pick up.
