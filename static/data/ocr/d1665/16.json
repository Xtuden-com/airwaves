Judg¬\ning from the responses received from broadcasts of this nature we are\nforced to the conclusion that a large part of the public is interested in\na radio program that instructs, and may properly lay some claim to\nculture and refinement in its entertainment numbers.\nWe do not think that Radio will be a panacea for all the ills of\nmankind, but we do believe it is one way of supplying helpful informa¬\ntion to many who are in a receptive frame of mind, and that as a tool\nfor promoting education, it is bound to occupy a position of import¬\nance, second only to the art of printing in the long list of inventions\nthat have proven to be a boon to mankind.\n“If what you want is a dead level of mediocrity, if what you\nwould like is a nation of identical twins, without initiative, intelligence,\nor ideas, you should fear the universities. From this standpoint uni¬\nversities are subversive. They try to make their students think; they\ndo not intend to manufacture so many imitative automatons. By help¬\ning the students learn to think the universities tend to make them re-\nsisant to pressure, to propaganda, or even to reward. They tend to\nmake them dissatisfied—if there were no dissatisfactions there would\nbe no progress—and they are likely to make them want to do some¬\nthing to improve the conditions under which our people live.”\n—Robert M. Hutchins,\nPresident, the University of Chicago.\n-16-"
