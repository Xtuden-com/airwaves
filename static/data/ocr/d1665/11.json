In¬\nstead of turning the radio on for hours at a time, each listener, by con¬\nsulting the various notices of radio programs, can select his radio curri¬\nculum with just as great care. If each owner of a receiving set would\nadopt this plan, it is probable that there would be 90 per cent less\nlistening than at present, but none of the good programs would be\noverlooked and the general effect upon the entire population would be\nthe reverse of what it is today. As a further result, stations would\nenlist the aid of educational authorities in preparing programs which\nwould gradually raise standards—a type of program found rarely today.\nWOJ\nIRON-DUST OF STARS\nHave they taken the dream away even from stars\nWhen they question the star-streaming beauty of Mars?\nAre the red Betelgeuse and Antares so cold\nThat the white and blue Rigel and Achernar hold\nGreater glamour for lovers because they are hot\nAnd on isochromatic plate filter a spot\nWhich shows visual magnitude greater by far\nThan the photographs tell of the cooler red star?\nSince this star-dust descending red-molten to ground\nUnder scientists’ spectroscopes plainly was found\nTo be made up of basalts and oxygen gas\nWhich were fused and then cooled to coagulate mass,\nShall the naked eye find it no longer can dream\nBecause luminous stars are not just what they seem?\nOr will life not empirical still remain odd\nAnd both lover and scientist ponder on God?\n—Ruth Genevieve Van Horn.\n-9 -"
