This legislation deals with\none of the most important matters facing Con¬\ngress this year and should be given prompt atten¬\ntion on the Senate floor and in the House.\nGenerally speaking, the bill reported out of\ncommittee this week is good. It creates a Corpo¬\nration for Public Television to support noncom¬\nmercial television and radio and authorizes an\nappropriation of $9 million for its first year of\noperations. The Committee took recognition of\nthe need to insulate the Corporation from political\npressure by providing that only 9 of its 15 direc¬\ntors be appointed by the President and confirmed\nby the Senate. The other six directors will be\nelected by the nine presidential appointees. While\nwe wish the Committee had gone farther and\nprovided for representation of local educational\nstations on the board of directors, this appears to\nbe a satisfactory way to start the Corporation. In\nany event, the ability of the Corporation to operate\nunfettered by political pressure will depend heav¬\nily on the character of the men named to run\nit and on the kind of financing available to it.\nBy deferring the question of permanent financ¬\ning until next year, as requested by the President,\nthe Commerce Committee has given itself time\nto make a thorough study of several possible\nsystems. It should lose no time in getting on with\nthat study. The question is difficult because the\nsums of money needed to operate a truly good\npublic television system are large and the need\nto find a method of raising them that is free from\npolitical influence is great."
