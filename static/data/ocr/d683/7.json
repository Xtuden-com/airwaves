However, it misses the opportunity\nto reinforce the Senate Commerce Committee's amendment of the\nbill calling for a Public Broadcasting concept.\nThe Senate Committee's change in the title of the bill and\nthe name of the Public Corporation recognizes that radio and\ntelevision should be seen as complementary resources that must\nboth be used fully to meet the varied educational,cultural,\nand social demands of our society.\nTimes' critic Jack Gould, who has helped greatly to give radio\nnew visibility in his columns of the press and the halls of\nthe Congress, noted in a February 26 article that radio has\nbeen \"a victim of the discrimination that surely should be\ncorrected in any long-range consideration...\" The Senate bill,\nas amended, does precisely that and the likelihood of\neducational broadcasting being able to serve through both its\nmedia is considerably enhanced by the conceptual implications\nof their amendments.\nBoth the problems and the promise that the Times anticipates\nfor television also relate to radio, not because the media\nidentical, but because together they represent a total a\nfor service that can not be fulfilled by either one alone.\nSincerely yours.\nWilliam G.\nPresident\nHarley ^ /\nWGH:mab"
