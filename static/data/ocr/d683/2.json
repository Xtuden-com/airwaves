BUILDING\nCITY NATIONAL BANK BUILDING\nMIAMI, FLORIDA\nNATIONAL BA I\n'ETERSBURO, FLORIDA\n'FOWHITE'\nPLEASE REPLY TO :\nP. O. BOX 1-436\nTAMPA, FLORIDA\n33001\nMay 9, 1967\nHonorable Torbert H. MacDonald\nCongressman from Massachusetts\nHouse Office Building\nWashington, D. C.\nDear Congressmans\nThe proposed legislation for federal support for public broadÂ¬\ncasting which is currently being discussed by committees of the\nCongress I believe is a very positive 3tep in developing these\nresources of our country.\nDuring the years I was president of the National Association of\nBroadcasters I became increasingly aware of how integral a part\nof American life radio is even though television has commanded a\ngreat deal of attention in recent years.\nWhile commercial radio has served the public interest commendably\nin the areas of news, public affairs, and entertainment, it is\nthrough the development of the full potential of non-commercial\neducational radio that these interests can and should be fully\nserved.\nHere in Florida we have plans for using radio on all levels of\neducation for both children and adults and I know such use would\nbe applicable and advantageous throughout the country."
