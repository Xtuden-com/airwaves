  "text": "The Hon. James Broyhill\nJuly 21, 1967\nPage 2.\nUnder HR 6736, grants will fall into three main categories:\n1. Grants will be made to local stations for operations\nand for programs which will be produced and broadÂ¬\ncast locally.\n2. Grants will be made to larger stations, production\ncenters, or state and regional networks for\nproduction of programs of regional or national\ninterest. Finished programs on film or tape could\nbe distributed by mail, fed on leased lines at\noff-peak hours and re-recorded at the option of\neach local studio for subsequent broadcast at the\nconvenience of the local station.\n3. Occasional grants to stations or regional or national\nnetworks will be made for the origination of special\nevents broadcasts picked up at a studio or remote\nlocation and fed over leased lines, contracted for\nthe occasion, for simultaneous transmission and\nbroadcast to stations who choose to carry them to a\nregion or across the country.\nClearly, the lines within which the Corporation is allowed to\nact under HR 6736 afford no possibility of it turning into a\nFederal network; rather, it will have the role of a private\nfoundation, evaluating proposals and dispensing funds to help\nothers undertake diverse activities. The Corporation will be\nsupportive, not operative.\nWe hope these comments may be helpful to the Committee in its\nconsideration of this important legislation.\nSincerely yours\nWilliam G.
