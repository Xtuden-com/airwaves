Washington Post Staff Writer\n| The House passed the Pub-\n| lie Broadcasting Act last night\n| by a 265 to 91 vote, taking a\n‘.long step that might signifi¬\ncantly change the American\nsystem of broadcasting.\nI The final roll call vote came\n| after a Republican move to\n| eliminate the corporation was\n| defeated, 194 to 167.\n| The act opens the way. for\n] Federal support of non-com-\nImercial educational radio and\n| television programs.\n> A similar bill zipped through\n| the Senate in May with only\n] one dissenting vote.\nI Both chambers agreed on\n1 three main provisions. They\n| are extension of the 1962 Edu¬\ncational TV Facilities Act with\n' appropriations to help build\njand improve educational sta-\ni tions; creation of a nonprofit\npublic broadcasting corpora-\n' tion, with $9 million in Fed-\n; eral funds as its initial financ-\n'l ing, which would help sup¬\nport private production of cul-\n\\ tural and educational pro-\n| grams and their distribution\nto nonprofit stations; and ap¬\npropriation of $500,000 for a\n; study of instructional TV.\nUncertainty?\nj Opponents argued that its\n| future financing had been\nI left uncertain and that it\nJ could conceivably become a\n| mechanism for political propa-\n! ganda for the party in power,\n: even though it would not be\n' a government agency but a\nseparate entity governed by a\n15-man board of directors.\n| The longest wrangles of the\nI day came over three separate\nj! attempts to shift the funding\nj of the public broadcasting cor-\nJporation’s future activities to\ni a tax on commercial broadcast-\nI ing stations. Each time, Demo¬\ncratic floor leader Harley\nStaggers (W.Va.) persuaded a\nmajority that the entire ques¬\ntion of long-range financing\nmust await study and another\nround of Congressional hear¬\nings.\nFinancing Question\nIn his message to Congress\nearlier this year requesting\ncreation of the public broad¬\ncasting corporation, President\nJohnson carefully avoided any\nsuggestion of long-range fi¬\nnancing. But the Carnegie\nCommission on Educational\nTV had proposed that the best\nmethod would be an excise\ntax on the sale of TV receiv¬\ners. That tax would start at 2\nper cent and be raised to a\nceiling of 5 per cent. The\nHouse bill did not authorize\nan excise tax or any other\nfinances beyond the initial $9\nmillion.\nThe House version of the\nbill' makes available a total\nof $38 million over the next\nthree years for construction\nunder the 1962 Educational Fa¬\ncilities Act. Immediately, in\nview is $10.5 million for fiscal\n1968. The House, would also\nprovide $12.5 million in 1969\nand $15 million in 1970. Pro¬\nponents of this measure\nstressed repeatedly that the\nmoney is for equipment, con¬\nstruction or improvement of\nstation facilities*—not for pro¬\ngrams.\nNo Endorsements\nThe House Bill—unlike the\nSenate prohibits a station\nfrom taking an editorial stand\nor endorsing a political can¬\ndidate.\nIn the House bill, the fifteen\nmembers of the Public Broad¬\ncasting Corp. are to be ap¬\npointed by the President, with\nthe consent of the Senate, and\nnot more than eight can be\nmembers of one political party\n—a provision not in the Sen¬\nate version. The House also\nwould require auditing of the\ncorporation by the General\nAccounting Office.\nNext step is the House-Sen¬\nate conference where differ¬\nences in the two versions must\nbe ironed out."
