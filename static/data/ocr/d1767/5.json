This fact is very important for teachers, since they\ndesire to have their students acquire serious listener attitudes.\nThe Federal Radio Education Committee has assumed a large\nshare of the responsibility for initiating and for coordinating\nresearch studies which throw light on several of the areas described\nin this scheme of classification. There yet remains the larger\njob of bringing the researches together under the categories set\nforth in this report. When a ready reference of radio research beÂ¬\ncomes available, many of the most valuable studies will be taken out\nof the realm of the purely academic. We will then have taken a long\nstep forward in realizing the potentialities of radio as a cultural\nmedium.\n(Signed) John W Studebaker\nU S Commissioner of Education and\nChairman, Federal Radio Education\nCommittee\nix"
