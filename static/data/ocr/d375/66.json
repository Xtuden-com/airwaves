Using questions which cane to\nGovernor Robert S. Kerr (now Senator Kerr, D., Okla.) from the\npeople themselves, each week Ken put the Governor through the third\ndegree on every function of state government, and its effect on the\naverage citizen.\nThe ”big stories” in Ken Miller’s radio news career include the\nPryor, Oklahoma tornado in 1942, when Ken broadcast to the nation\nfrom the disaster scene, with a hodge-podge hookup which Included\nshort wave radio, rural telephones and the National Broadcasting\nCompany. Between broadcasts Ken helped the disaster crews with\nthe 77 dead and nearly £00 Injured.\nDuring 194-0 and 1941* Ken took his microphone to the construction\nsite of the Grand River Dam at Vinita, Oklahoma, and brought his\nlisteners an on-the-scene report of the dam construction, the\nsquabble over roadways in the vicinity, the halting of construction\nby Then-Governor Leon C. Phillips, and the ensuing settlement end\nfinal dedication of the completed structure.\nOne of Ken’s most remarkable innovations in radio journalism is\nAssignment Southwest”, a twice-weekly radio feature dealing with\nthe people, the places and the happenings of Ken’s own beloved\nsouthwest. It may be the story of a farm woman who makes dolls\nfrom burlap sacks, corn cobs and bits of yarn...it may be the story\nof a big new glass factory.•.or it may be the story of a turkey¬\ncalling contest or a strawberry festival."
