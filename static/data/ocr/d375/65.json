He’s always been so\nthoroughly covered up with radio news, and with pioneering new\nprograms and new techniques, that he has no time for outside ac¬\ntivities. His one hobby is his pretty 17-year-old daughter, with\nwhom he spends only about a tenth the time he’d like to spend.\nOne of his most widely publicized program innovations was his\n”SouthwestPorura” which won for the year 1944 the George Poster\nPeabody Award of the Grady School of Journalism at the University\nof Georgia. This program originated from the state capitals of a\ndozen southwestern and midwestern states, and featured state legis¬\nlators, governors and leaders of business and industry, in a\nforum-type show that drew a graphic cpmparative picture of state\ngovernments...taxes...highway and industrial development.\nThe small towns of Oklahoma drew the spotlight of radio in Ken’s\nseries entitled \"Main Street Speaks”, on which the merchants,\nfarmers and business men of the small towns went on the air to\ndiscuss their problems, failures and successes."
