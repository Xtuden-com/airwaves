  "text": "Page 2 - Ken Miller\nKen once threw a brick at one of the rodents and knocked a big hole\nin the wall...where, in retaliation, the rat hid himself in an\ninaccessible spot and diedl\nRadio News in those days was picked up anywhere and any way pos¬\nsible. Donny often said that if one of the Tulsa papers ever failed\nto hit the streets, KVOO couldn*t go on the air with a news broad¬\ncast. No one had ever heard of a radio news reporter...or even a\nfull-fledged radio news department. So, it was up to Ken to beg,\nborrow or steal the daily news...bringing it up to the minute with\nlater developments, new leads, and other methods of avoiding out-\nand-out plagiarism. Ken had already been initiated into the news\nbusiness by a succession of hard-boiled city editors on the Tulsa\nWorld and the Hughes County Tribune at Holdenville, Oklahoma, so\nhe knew how to get the news one way or another.\nShortly after Ken started to work as KVOO News Director, the nation¬\nwide tussle with the wire services began. Just as Ken and KVOO were\nbeginning to establish a comprehensive system of gathering news,\nthe rug was yanked out from under them. All the services pulled\ntheir machines out of radio stations, and an all-out war against\nradio, the ”black threat to newspaper Journalism”, was launched.\nBut, the big rug had been yanked out from under every station in\nthe nation, and the stations soon got together to do something about\nit.\nOut of that alliance came Trans-Radio Press, which in the inter¬\nvening years became so good that the wire services relented and\nworked out a plan to include radio as a legitimate subscriber."
