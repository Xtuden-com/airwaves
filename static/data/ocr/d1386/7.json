There is no pos¬\nsibility of covering up mistakes or of\ncorrecting them in the next perform¬\nance, for a broadcast is strictly a \"one\nnight stand.” Everything must be timed,\nanticipated, correlated, and interpreted\nbefore the ruby light in the studio gives\nthe broadcast the air. Hence the need\nfor rehearsing.\nIt may be news to some that from\nten to thirty times the actual length of\nthe broadcast is spent in rehearsals on\nleading network features. A total of\n670 hours is used, for example, in pre¬\nparing the six 15-minute periods of\nthe Chesterfield \"Music That Satisfies”\nseries every week. It is broken down\nin this manner: It takes 10 hours to\nmake one 3-minute orchestration, and\n12 hours to copy the parts of all the\ninstruments in the orchestra—a total of\n22 hours for each selection. Thirty\nselections are produced each week, re¬\nquiring 660 hours of preparation. Add\nto this a minimum of 10 hours of actual\nrehearsing in the radio studio, and the\nfigure totals up to 670 hours!\nThe \"March of Time” broadcasts are\nan example of the painstaking effort\nspent on script acts. Since the programs\ndeal with the news events of the week,\npresenting in dramatized form outstand¬\ning happenings throughout the world,\nconstant revision and additions to the\nscript are necessary almost up to the\nminute of the broadcast. Actual re¬\nhearsal time for the half-hour programs\naverages 17 hours. A regular group of\n20 extras is used for crowd noises—\nthe shouting of students in college riots\nor celebrations, the marching of soldiers,\nthe applause of audiences, the singing\nof vast assemblages, etc., etc. Fifteen\nprincipals, who are selected with a view\ntoward doubling as closely as possible\nfor the voices of the characters they in¬\nterpret, spend many hours in cast re¬\nhearsals before the music and crowd\nnoises are added. Howard Barlow, con¬\nductor on the program, attends the cast\nrehearsals to form a picture of the events\nin order to select appropriate musical\ninterpolations and accompaniments. Fi¬\nnally, throughout the rehearsals a defi¬\nnite attempt is made to keep the show\nfast-moving and to eliminate any details\nwhich might detract from the strict\nnews representation of the program.\nThe Palooka Series\nAnother script act which requires an\nunusual amount of rehearsal is the Joe\nPalooka series. Ted Bergman, Columbia\nactor who plays the part of the lovable\nboob of the prize ring; Elsie Hitz, who\ninterprets the role of Anne Howe; Frank\nReadick, the Knobby Walsh of the\nstrip, and other principals in the cast\nspend from 5y2 to 4 hours for each 15-\nminute broadcast. In addition to this,\nMark Warnow and his orchestra hold\nspecial rehearsals for the musical in¬\nterpolations, after which the entire act\nis put together for the dress run-\nthrough.\nA similar procedure holds for the\nLove Story hour and the Eno Crime\nClub programs. For the former, Dana\nNoyes and Bill Sweets rehearse the cast\nfor two hours; and George Earle con¬\nducts the orchestra in a rehearsal of the\nsame length, but the two groups never\ncombine for a single run-through before\nthe program is actually on the air.\nNoyes, who is a former movie director,\nhas to a large degree adapted the movie\ntechnique for radio purposes. His re¬\nhearsals are divided into small bits, with\neach incident in the drama worked out\nsingly. Noyes never allows the entire\nshow to be given even for a dress re¬\nhearsal, because he is convinced that too\nsmooth a performance before the actual\nbroadcast may be followed by a let-down\nin the air show itself.\nThe Eno Crime Club presentations re¬\nquire three hours of rehearsal time for\ntheir half-hour programs. After a read¬\ning of the play by the cast, under the\ndirection of Jay Hannah, a run-through\nat the microphone is held, sound effects\nand crowd noises added, individual\nlines cut and corrected, and the dress\nrehearsal completed just before going on\nthe air.\nThe Columnist Gag\nThe La Gerardine programs, the latest\nof which is Sidney Skolsky’s \"Broadway\nTintypes,” were the first to discover col¬\numnists as potential network attractions.\nThey presented Walter Winchell, then\nEd Sullivan, and now Skolsky. These\nprograms, bringing, as they do, many\noutstanding guest artists of the stage and\nscreen with dramatizations of outstand¬\ning incidents in their lives, require the\nmost careful type of rehearsing. For the\n15-minute broadcasts, an average of\neight full hours af rehearsal time is nec¬\nessary to coordinate the script with the\nincidental music, and to prepare the\nshow for air performance.\nFinally, the Gem Highlights program\nof the American Safety Razor Corpora¬\ntion has added a new and extremely val¬\nuable element to broadcast rehearsals.\nThe program presents Ed Sullivan,\nBroadway columnist, with a host of stars\nof the theatrical and sporting worlds,\nand Jack Denny, noted orchestra leader,\nin his Highlights of Rhythm. Although\nthe broadcast is on Sunday, the re¬\nhearsals are begun the preceding Tues¬\nday. Sullivan and his cast, doubling for\nthe Broadway and sports stars who ap¬\npear on the actual broadcast, Mann\nHolliner, agency director of the program,\nDenny and his men go down to the\nColumbia studios in the morning and\nafter four and one-half hours of coach¬\ning take a recording of the half-hour\ndress rehearsal. The next day, Sullivan,\nHolliner, and Tom Breen (Columbia\nproduction man), join Nelson Green-\nhut, vice-president of the American\nSafety Razor Company, in criticizing the\nrecords of the rehearsal. Corrections\nfollow, and on the Sunday of the broad¬\ncast five more hours are spent in shap¬\ning the program for actual broadcast.\nNumerous air shows have been recorded\npreviously, but this is the first instance\nof the recording of a rehearsal in order\nto allow the artists to hear and criticize\ntheir own work each week before it goes\non the air. The Gem Highlights series\nthus offers the closest analogy to a try¬\nout before the show itself is staged.\nRepetition of Music\nColumbia Broadcasting System claims\nthat it can no longer be charged with\nrepeating popular numbers too fre¬\nquently on the air.\nA representative week of program\nactivities on the Columbia network\nshows that a total of 531 popular se¬\nlections were presented in the various\npresentations comprising 126 hours of\nbroadcasting. Of these 531 selections\nmore than half, a total of 293, were\nplayed but once during the entire week.\nSpecifically in order to prevent mo¬\nnotonous repetition of numbers on the\nair, the Columbia network has estab¬\nlished a rule prohibiting the presenta¬\ntion of the same selection at intervals\nof less than two hours. Therefore in\nthe 18 hours of broadcasting during a\nsingle day, it is impossible for a given\nnumber to be heard more than 6 times,\na maximum rarely approximated. At\nthe height of their popularity, songs are\nsometimes broadcast as many as five\ntimes in one day, that record having been\nset by \"My Mom” recently. But the\noverwhelming majority of songs are\nplayed but once in a day, and, as shown\nabove, usually but once in an entire\nweek.\n\"Lullaby of the Leaves” held the\nrecord for most frequent performances\nduring the week surveyed, having been\nplayed 18 times. \"Paradise” was a\nclose second with 17 performances and\n\"One Hour With You” took third place\nwith 14."
