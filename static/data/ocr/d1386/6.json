It is rapidly developing into a\nfavorite indoor sport.\nWhile fan mail originally was con¬\nsidered a real index to the popularity of\na program, volumes of it from listeners\nwere discouraged because of the cost of\nhandling. This response was entirely vol¬\nuntary, and generally consisted of com¬\nments upon the programs and the art¬\nists. There has been a falling off of this\ntype of letter, and a turn on the part of\nsponsors. Today, advertisers are hardly\nsatisfied unless the public shows by let¬\nter-applause that it listens to their pro¬\ngrams. And the greatest way of extract¬\ning that applause from the audience is\nby means of \"free” offers, contests, and\nsampling.\nAlthough network executives point\nout to sponsors that this fan mail proves\nnothing at all, a number of \"coupon”\noffers are aired nightly by leading ad¬\nvertisers. The majority of listeners do\nnot write to stations. It takes some¬\nthing unusual to make them reach for\npaper and pen. Ordinarily, the listener’s\nletter concerns a program change, or\nthe artists. If a new artist is introduced\non a well-established hour, or if the\ntype of program is modified, it will in¬\nvariably draw general mail, as will the\nreturn of an old favorite performer.\nNetwork executives believe that this\ntype of response shows real listener in¬\nterest.\nBut advertising and sales managers\nof national firms using broadcasting for\npromoting sales want to see more con¬\ncrete results. Hence the enormous\npopularity—with them—of the \"free\noffer” and contest ideas now currently\nused. Of the two types of mail-getters,\nthe contest draws the most.\nThe psychology of mail response is\neasy to appreciate from the advertiser’s\nviewpoint. There was a program spon¬\nsored by a large firm on one of the net¬\nworks which drew about ten to twelve\nletters per broadcast. The advertiser\ncomplained that the program was on a\n\"dead spot” because it was spotted in\nan afternoon period which presumably\nwas not being heard. The offer of a\nbooklet and a free sample drew 3,437\nrequests after a single mention. The\nnext offer brought the number of letters\nwell above the 9,000 mark. It proved\nto the advertiser that his program was\nreally being heard, although previous to\nAdvertisers using radio are slowly\nrealizing that broadcasting can sup¬\nply them with the lowest cost per in¬\nquiry on a \"coupon” basis. The in¬\ncreased use among sponsors of con¬\ntests, free offers, and other direct\nappeals to the listeners shows the\nfirst step toward the proper utiliza¬\ntion of radio for direct sales to\nlisteners.\nhis free offer, no mail response from\nhis audience was evident.\nAs an example of the type of response\nwhich can be secured from a radio au¬\ndience, the experience of the Pepsodent\nCompany is classic. Over 850,000\nbeetleware tumblers were distributed as\na result of free offers to the radio lis¬\nteners. After a ten-day announcement\non the \"Goldbergs” program, more\nthan 1,000,000 sample bottles of mouth¬\nwash were sent out in the mails to lis¬\nteners writing in for them. And these\nresults are no indication of what might\nhave been produced by way of inquiries\nhad the offers continued.\nAdvertising managers and network\nexecutives confess, however, that results\ncannot always be guaranteed. What will\nprove a huge success on one program\nmay produce very little results on\nanother, though spotted at the same\nrelative time and worded in practically\nthe same fashion. Some programs, as\nfor example the Kellogg-sponsored\n\"Singing Lady,” are popular in their\nown right, and children’s mail without\nfree offers or sampling is unusually\nhigh. It has been found, on the other\nhand, that even good contests will not\npull mail.\nThe \"coupon” type of broadcasting—\nwhich resembles the coupon idea as\nused in magazine and newspaper adver¬\ntising—has for purpose the building up\nof a mailing list for further advertising\nby direct mail, or the compiling of a\ncalling list for salesmen, and is used for\nspreading the buying of a particular\nproduct. It is the most important by¬\nproduct of broadcasting which sponsors\nsecure.\nAs a direct mail proposition, the radio\n\"coupon” idea may be a tremendously\ncostly operation. Consider, for example,\nthe mechanical cost of handling the\nPepsodent mail mentioned above. There\nmust be some way in which expenses\ncan be written off, and a method has\nbeen found. Free offers pay for them¬\nselves if sponsors require the five cigar\nbands, the top of a can of coffee, or the\nlabel from a tooth-paste box.\nBecause the radio coupon is a mail\nidea, the cost per inquiry, as with any\ncoupon offer, becomes important. The\nshort announcement Phillips milk of\nmagnesia once interrupted its program\nto make, yielded 128,000 pieces of mail,\nwhich brought the cost per inquiry for\nthat week to a very low point indeed.\nIn an actual test made by a national\nadvertiser using magazines and radio\n\"coupons,” it was found that broadcast¬\ning brought in inquiries at half the cost\nof the publications used. An \"equiva¬\nlent” circulation coverage was used in\nboth cases, with the same expenditure\nof money and the same formula. Radio\nqueries cost that advertiser 25 cents each.\nSome radio coupons have brought in a\nvolume of answers at a cost of only 3\ncents each! Advertisers are slowly be¬\nginning to realize that radio, properly\nused, is the ideal way of getting returns\nat lowest cost per query.\nAt the present time, a form of radio\ncontest known as a word contest is\nfavored by broadcast advertisers. These\nhave been more successful than other\nkinds of air contests because they\nnecessitate neither opinions nor letter¬\nwriting, and remove from every con¬\ntestant’s mind the possibility of \"fak¬\ning.” Besides, they are a real challenge\nto the listening audience, and actual re¬\nsults can be tabulated easily.\nNetwork executives hesitate to recom¬\nmend free offers and contests of any\ntype, because of the uncertainty of re¬\nsults and the wide differences in costs.\nFor example, a hair wave account made\nan offer over the air, and felt that if\nit received several thousand answers, the\neffort was well repaid. It was ready to\nhandle about 10,000 pieces of mail, but\nmore than 20,000 letters were re¬\nceived. . . .\nAnother firm decided to spend only\n$13,000 on a free offer and to broad¬\ncast it for eight weeks. These offers\ncost 25 cents each, and a tremendous\nresponse was had which went far\nbeyond the original appropriation for\nthe purpose.\nNetworks are hoping that the craze\nand popularity of contests and free\noffers will die down before it becomes\ntoo deeply rooted into the radio struc¬\nture. Quantity of mail is deceptive, al¬\nthough it certainly is impressive in com¬\nparison with other forms of securing re¬\nturns. If the sponsors want to know\nwhether the audience is actually listen¬\ning, they are willing to suggest a \"try,”\nbut discourage it as a regular feature of\nany broadcast series."
