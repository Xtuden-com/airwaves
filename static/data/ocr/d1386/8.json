Wheelahan\nRadio Station WSMB, New Orleans\nMany regional stations in the United\nStates point with pride to framed veri¬\nfications received from Australia or\nAlaska. We have done it ourselves, al¬\nthough conscious that we render no real\nservice to those areas. Engineers credit\nto a regional station a service area with\na radius of about 30 miles, although\nmany stations can prove they hold a\nregular audience within an area far in\nexcess of that.\nAnd probably both are correct in their\nstatements. The apparent contradiction\nlies in the fact that the builders of trans¬\nmitters must claim only the minimum\ncapabilities of their equipment, in order\nthat their claims may not be refuted\nwhen the installation takes place under\nadverse conditions or in thickly settled\ncenters.\nCan you imagine a 5 00-watt station\nin Chicago or New York receiving a\nlong distance call along the following\nlines:\n\"Hello, are you the manager of\nWSMB? Well, I am Jim Smith, of\nColumbus, Mississippi. Your news re¬\nporter omitted the cotton market quo¬\ntations on the one o’clock broadcast to¬\nday.”\n\"I am sorry for this oversight, Mr.\nSmith; if you listen for the next ten\nminutes, I will have the cotton quota¬\ntions broadcast for you. By the way, Mr.\nSmith, you are 270 miles from our city,\nairline, and I am surprised to learn any¬\none listens to us at that distance. Does\nanybody else in your town ever listen\nto us?”\n\"Yes indeed they do. Cotton is our\nvery existence, you know, and yours is\nthe only station broadcasting cotton quo¬\ntations regularly; while there are other\nstations that come in stronger, we listen\nto you often during the day.”\nThis is a conversation, almost ver¬\nbatim, which took place between the\nwriter and a farmer in northern Mis¬\nsissippi. Yet, while we may get out as\nfar as 270 miles in the daytime, we do\nnot have regular listeners at such a dis¬\ntance in all directions. The variance in\ncoverage distance is not due to signal\nstrength. It is because in the lesser areas\nother stations of equal program merit\nlay down a stronger signal, by rea¬\nson of location or power. This is proved\nby the extent of our night coverage in\nall directions. As an example, we are\nhabitually listened to for 175 miles in\n♦Opinions of station managers on Edgar H.\nFelix’s statement that broadcast stations claim en¬\ntirely too much coverage.\na northwesterly direction in daytime, al¬\nthough at night a town only 100 miles\naway in that direction favors a 50,000-\nwatter which is 300 miles distant, but\nwhich serves them the same programs\nwe do, with a better signal.\nIt is to be expected that radios 200\nmiles distant from a station will experi¬\nence some interference and fading;\nnevertheless the station, with a good\nprogram, that furnishes the strongest\ncomparative signal renders that locality\na good service. I can remember a world’s\nchampionship fight in Chicago several\nyears ago, when every radio set owner in\nNew Orleans listened to a Chicago sta¬\ntion and enjoyed hugely the two-thirds\nthey did hear.\nMr. Wheelahan\nThe Gulf of Mexico is 60 miles to\nthe south of New Orleans, and we have\nnot definitely determined our day or\nnight coverage, but it seems in excess\nof our northern coverage, largely by rea¬\nson of the fact that we are at all times\nthe closest station to ships that are south\nof Louisiania and Mississippi. We have\nset aside a day and a night period for\ncommunication with pleasure craft and\nschooners that do not have wireless, and\nmany people state they have heard our\nmessage 300 or 400 miles away.\nOur own experience, then, demon¬\nstrates that a 500-watt station, work¬\ning at its maximum efficiency and under\nfavorable conditions, can render a good\nservice for a radius of 150 to 250 miles\ndaytime and 75 to 125 miles night.\nAnd when stations do not serve such\nan area, it is mainly due to the fact\nthat there are other stations, whose pro¬\ngrams are just as good, laying down a\nstronger signal in the same areas.\nBy Earl J. Glade\nRadio Station KSL, Salt Lake City\nOut in the West we naturally deal\nin magnificent distances. Our population,\nobviously, is relatively light, and there\nis not the man-made interference which\nyou have confronting your stations in\nthe metropolitan centers of the East.\nIt is not too much to say that we can\ndo with 5 kilowatts in this great out-of-\ndoors country more than can be done\nwith a similar wattage in the populous\ncenters of the East.\nHowever, we have some smaller sta¬\ntions whose managements are the most\nambitious map-drawers in captivity. The\nmanner in which they can make a one\nkilowatt signal spread over a radius of\nfive hundred miles leaves little indeed to\nbe desired. The public, however, knows\nthat these maps have, as a rule, only\nmodest respect for the truth. It is true,\nof course, that intermittent coverage in\ncertain spots can be secured with low\npower and less desirable frequency.\nThe public wants a ten millivolt per\nmeter signal, and no matter how am¬\nbitious the efforts of station draftsmen\nin laying out a map, the fact remains\nthat the Federal Radio Commission’s ex¬\nperts are right, generally speaking, in\nthe coverage indicated by them for sta¬\ntions of varying power. It is true that\nthe location of the transmitter and the\nquality of its ground, together with the\nabsence of man-made factors of disturb¬\nance, have a great bearing on this mat¬\nter. Possibly the biggest factor is free¬\ndom from disturbance on the frequency.\nOn a test we made recently for KLO,\na 500 watt station, between 1:00 and\n2:00 a. m., Mountain Time, we received\nmail from practically every state in the\nUnion, and lots of it. It would be fool¬\nish, however, for us, even on the\nstrength of this splendid showing, to\ncontend that our coverage is more than\njust a reasonable area including several\nadjacent counties.\nI realize that this is vague and is\nsomething that will have to be worked\nout with mathematical accuracy. I per¬\nsonally favor a modest computation of\ncoverage, and sell our sponsors on this\nbasis.\nDuring the dedicatory broadcast of\nKSL, which covered a twenty-four hour\nperiod, this station received approxi¬\nmately 52,000 telegrams, smashing all\nwestern America records, excepting that\nof the San Francisco fire, years ago.\nEvery state in the Union, and every\nprovince in Canada, excepting one, was\nrepresented. We never use such stunts\nas this in selling or in computing cov¬\nerage.\n(Continued on page 19)"
