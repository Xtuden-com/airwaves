It was being\n\"heard” before Examiner Pratt, and a\nnumber of other station managers, own¬\ners, and their legal advisers. I counted\nat least sixty present, and there were\nsome important, if not famous, names\namong the group. . . John V. L. Hogan,\nJudge Ira Robinson, Paul Spearman,\nMrs. Mabel Willebrandt, C. B. Joliffe,\nBrennen, Trendle.\nPreliminary arguments as to pro¬\ncedure started the thing off. Lawyers\nfenced back and forth, slowly, painfully,\nuntil a mutual ground of understanding\nwas reached. Then started the briefs for\nthe various stations. It was all very dull,\ndeadly slow, as are most things that con¬\ncern the law.\nAs the long minutes passed, and one\nwitness followed another in the seat by\nthe presiding examiner’s table on the\nplatform, the slow grind of the mill was\napparent. Arguments droned on, end¬\nlessly, uninterestingly, but \"for the rec¬\nord.”\nIT WAS impressive to see how the\nlawyer had replaced, in the space of\na few years indeed, the engineer and\ntechnician in matters of regulating and\nadministering to the field.\nIt may be this trend which makes it\nnecessary for stations to be unwilling de¬\nfenders in cases into which they are\nforcibly drawn, because of some far¬\naway complainant’s well-thought-out\nplan of battle. The manager of a metro¬\npolitan station has told me, for example,\nthat he has had to appear to defend his\ninterests in dozens of cases which hard¬\nly warranted even the hearing they re¬\nceived. But it was necessary for the sta¬\ntion to have a legal representative on\nthe job to watch things.\nFor its own protection, broadcasting\nshould develop a system which would\nprevent the wasteful use of legal talent\nand of the valuable time consumed in\nargument. While it is true that every\ncase is entitled to a hearing, it is also\na fact that not a few cases are brought\npurely for their \"nuisance” value. But\nthis \"nuisance” can be. very expensive\nto individual stations, and to broadcast¬\ning in general. I had occasion to appre¬\nciate how much, when I sat down at the\nhearing in the KYW-KFKX case. . .\nA Great Experiment\nWhen the Great Atlantic and Pacific\nTea Company, one of the largest users\nof time on the air was \"permitted” by\nVice-President Roy Witmer, sales man¬\nager of the National Broadcasting Com¬\npany, to announce, over the network it\nwas using, the prices of commodities it\nhad on sale there was a great silence in\nthe broadcast ranks. Was the network\nunbending at last, and lowering its own\nstandards of \"no price mention” over\nthe air?\nCarefully-worded statements by vari¬\nous officials made it appear that, indeed,\nit was a great concession on the part of\nthe network to its clients. Actually, the\nreverse was true.\nBranch presidents of the Great A. &\nP. organization, which spreads over the\nentire country, leaned more toward news¬\npaper advertising and voiced their views\nto headquarters in New York. It was un¬\navoidable that eventually the actual sales-\ngetting value of newspaper advertising\nspace should be compared with that of\nbroadcasting, in a great organization\nwhere costs are known down to a mill\nfor all operations.\nIn order to determine which medium\nwas best for the purpose, a test was nec¬\nessary. And in order to place the news¬\npaper and the air mediums on the same\nbasis, it was necessary to mention\nsomething about the prices of the com¬\nmodities.\nThe test is on. Colonel Goodbody\nsays his little piece over the duplex net¬\nworks of National every morning that\nhe speaks. And the results are now be¬\ning compiled.\nThe first week or so, the reports\nwhich poured in to headquarters in New\nYork, through the amazingly well-organ¬\nized system of inter-office communica¬\ntion, indicated that more than 7,000\nstores were showing an increase in sales\nas a result of the new policy. What the\nultimate reports will disclose cannot be\nforetold now. But it will be very evident\nto the various newspaper-sympathetic re¬\ngional presidents of the A. & P. that the\njudicious use of broadcasting can be a\npowerful factor in national merchandis¬\ning.\nIf anyone deserves the praise which\nshould go with any innovation, it seems\nto me that it is the courageous official in\nthe great grocery organization who had\nthe foresight to try out this new policy.\nBroadcasting can only gain from this\nnew trend.\nIT HAS been a favorite thought of\nmine that broadcasting was going to\nprove itself a powerful sales force dur¬\ning the present business cycle, or suffer\na permanent set-back as an advertising\nmedium which it will take years to over¬\ncome.\nCritics of broadcast advertising, such\nas the newspapers and certain advertis¬\ning groups, have objected loudly to the\n\"blatancy” of advertising on the air, and\nI am not so sure that they aren’t right.\nOne of the things which contributed to\nthis was undoubtedly the restriction\nwhich the chains placed on the ad¬\nvertiser. He had to make his message\nlonger and more \"powerful” since he\ncould not mention the price of the com¬\nmodity he wished to sell to the listening\npublic.\nOne of the first effects of price men¬\ntion on the air should be to cut down\nthe amount of advertising in the an¬\nnouncements.\nSponsored Football\nWHEN Major Phillip B. Fleming,\npresident of the Eastern Intercol¬\nlegiate Association, told the sport col¬\numnists that grid games fought on home\ngrounds or under jurisdiction of the as¬\nsociation would not be broadcast, he\nstarted something.\nImmediately, the New York Boxing\nCommission said something unkind\nabout broadcasting, and read a rule about\n\"approved announcers.” Then the\nSoutheastern and the Western football\nassociations fell into line. And it looks\nlike a dark and dreary fall in so far as\nsports broadcasts are concerned.\nTo my knowledge, no advertiser has\never \"sponsored” the chain broadcast of\na football game. It should prove to be a\nvery good investment, it seems to me,\nbecause this is a type of broadcast which\nhas a very special listener appeal and\nwhich gathers a unique and exclusive\ntype of audience around the loud\nspeaker.\nI doubt whether the various associa¬\ntions would turn down an interesting\ncontract for the broadcast rights of\nof the major grid contests. Pacific Coast\ninstitutions have already lent a willing\near to such commercialization of the\ngame. Perhaps something can be done\nwith the Eastern Association."
