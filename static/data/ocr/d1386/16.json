Many programs are getting\nfunny, each trying to outdo the other.\n. . . Some tuners-in give the laurels to\nEd Wynn. Others favor Jack Benny.\nHarry Richman also has been getting\na hand. Then there’s Bert Lahr; also\nOlsen and Johnson, the latest to get\nair-minded. We hope the trend brings\nback Will Rogers.”\nWriting in the Buffalo Evening\nNeivs, Peter Dixon states that \"though\nthe crop of radio humorists isn’t grow¬\ning, the quality of the product is im¬\nproving. Jack Benny is growing more\npopular with each broadcast. Even the\nradio veterans who have most resented\nthe arrival of the new stars from\nBroadway, admit he is funny. ...”\nTo which opinion, Louis Reid, col¬\numnist of the New York American,\ncontributes: \"Most consistently amus¬\ning chatter of the Broadway comics now\nelbowing their way to the microphone\nis that voiced by Jack Benny. . . . Right\nnow he’s doing things to gingerale and\nmaking you like both him and the boys\nwho bottle the stuff. ...”\nOne cannot tell how serious Ring\nLardner is with his critical columning\nprinted in the New Yorker, but he\ncommends Jack Benny with this little\nbit of explanation: \"My fondness for\nMr. and Mrs. Olsen’s band brought me\ninto airy contact with Jack Benny. He\nwas comical and I commended him to\nmy second child. ... You can quote\nme as saying that Mr. Benny would be\ninfinitely better off if his jokes weren’t\ngreeted with gales of merriment by Mr.\nand Mrs. Olsen’s band. Also as saying\nthat I am cured of plugging comics,\nthough you might tune in, when you\nhave a chance, on Stoopnagle and\nBudd, Burns and Allen, Mr. Wynn,\nMr. Lahr, Pat of the WOR Minstrels,\nand Jack Benny. ...”\nPhilosophising a little before he\nlaunches into his point, the New York\nEvening Telegram’s Jack Foster has\nthis angle to present: \"The quality of\ncomedy often, I think, is strained. In\nthe last year comedy has taken a full\nBROADCAST\nCOMMENT\nfrom the\nRADIO\nPRESS\nturn towards pure nonsense, toward the\nhumor of insane incongruities. The\nnext natural step is a broadcast from\nthe padded cells of Bellevue and Mat-\nteawan. Possibly it’s a shrinking from\nthe realities of the depression that has\nmade Wynn, Burns-and-Allen, Olsen-\nand-Johnson nonsense so delightful to\nthe ears .of the listeners. . . .\n\"It strikes me that those acts with\nthe most flexible forms have the great¬\nest chance of remaining fresh—and I\npick at random—Jack Benny, George\nOlsen, Ethel Shutta, Franz Frey com¬\nbination, and Ben Bernie and his lads.\nMr. Benny relies on no same situation\nweekly. . . . His wit is balanced by\nsplendid singing and a fine orches¬\ntra. . . .\n\"Ben Bernie, who was the first of\nthe aerial wits and in many respects\nthe foremost, is not unlike his name¬\nsake. Ben can become tiresome only if\nhis jokes are poor and you fail to find\nhis rich, exceedingly intimate voice ap-\nA New Service for Our Readers\nEvery week, the National Broad¬\ncast Reporter will print a review of\ncritical comments about broadcasting\nas expressed by the radio columnists,\neditors, and writers of the leading\nnewspapers of the country. These\ncomments, drawn from the nation’s\npress, provide the best cross-section\nof opinion regarding program accept¬\nance and popularity that it is possible\nto secure.\nWhile chain features will necessar¬\nily furnish the bulk of comment,\nlocal broadcasts of importance will\nbe quoted as they are high-spotted\nor mentioned by local writers. This\nradio critical survey aims at giving a\ncomplete picture of broadcast opin¬\nion as voiced by the country’s lead¬\ning radio writers and commentators\nwhich should be of great value to\nadvertisers, advertising agencies, and\nstation managers.\npealing . . . which has all the qualities\nthat a microphone fellow need possess\n—warmth, smoothness, and gayety.\nSome more localized opinions on the\nhumor situation bring forth the\nYoungstown, Ohio, Telegram’s idea of\nEd Wynn: \"As a fire fighter, Ed Wynn\nis unique. He started a great con¬\nflagration in radio-land by proving him¬\nself as hot a sketch on the air as on\nthe stage. With his zany comedy he\ninflamed the imagination of the radio\npublic and the air ambitions of an im¬\nposing array of Broadway jesters. Now\nthe networks are all ablaze with star\ncomedians following in his brilliant\nwake. . . . He can’t be funny unless\nhe feels funny. So he changes his\nfunny hats and costumes on the air and\ngoes through regular routine as a stage\npersonality. He is one of the most'\nconscientious comedians ever seen in a\nbroadcasting studio. . . .” To which\nthis reporter adds that the studio seats\nare a \"sell out” every time Wynn ap¬\npears.\nOlsen and Johnson, one of radio’s\nnewest pairs of comics, who came on\nthe air with a flurry of drums and\ntrumpets, seem to be gathering small\ncomment from the critic scribes. How¬\never, Jo Ransom’s column in the Brook¬\nlyn Daily Eagle refers to them, and to\nother pet comedians, as follows:\n\"Burns and Allen. Yes, a comedy\nteam on the air lanes. A team with\na dozen imitators on the other stations,\nfor, like Amos and Andy, they are be¬\ning aped here and there and every¬\nwhere. . . . Their chatter is nonsensical,\nludicrous, zany. People like it.\nThey’ve arrived after many years of\ntraipsing over vaudeville routes and\nmaking shorts, but it took radio to\nmake them. . . . Olsen and Johnson\nmade their debut on the air with Rudy\nVallee. After listening to the boys, I\ncouldn’t make up my mind whether\nthey were Sisters of the Skillet or the\nGloomchasers plus Ed Wynn in dis¬\nguise. That terrific laugh of Johnson’s\n(or does it belong to Olsen?) should\nbring them many friends among lis¬\nteners.”\nDiverging still a little more, the col¬\numnist of the Jersey Journal decides\nthat there are others on the air besides\nthose commented on above. \"WABC’s\nFunnyboners, who always justify their\nname, gave a series of amusing, help¬\nful hints for motorists, along with sev¬\neral torrid songs, in their characteristic\nand tricky manner. This trio is always\na cure for the blues. . . . NBC’s Steb-\nbins Boys—Arthur Alien and Parker\nFennelly—ably assisted by Inchy, get\na lot of comedy into our loudspeaker\nduring their quarter hour. ...”"
