We hope that you will do\nall within your power to secure the passage of this bill.\nUnlike many, we do not oppose additional taxation if these funds\nare used constructively. This act is on excellent example of the kind of\nproject that should be supported by federal funds.\nUnfortunately, we must protest your continued support of U.5.\naggression in Viet Nam. We do not fight communism there: v/e are\nplaying into the communist's hands. We should be supporting this\nuprising of the Vietnamese people rather than supressing it.\nYours truly,\nArthur P. Jacoby"
