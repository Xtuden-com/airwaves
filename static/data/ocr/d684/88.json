Marquis\nCommittee Characteristics:\n(Total Committee: 31)\nRepublicans - (14 on Committee)\nBusinessmen - (13 on Committee)\nLawyers - (14 on Committee)\nEast of Mississippi - (23 on Committee)\nPoorly informed re Public Broadcasting Act - (31 on Committee!)\nConclusion:\nStories must be diverse, simple, and show direct gain to various component\naudiences of communities and regions. Speakers must be brief, direct, and\nspeak from clear leadership roles in their communities. We hope we can have\nsome witnesses from Districts of committee members. If no committee member\nis related to a witness, we should have witness's- Representative introduce him.\nIf this is not possible, we should include a statement from that Representative.\nAnd we hope to have several governors who can themselves testify.\nGeneral Plan:\nNAEB will not appear by its own internal Divisions, but rather by broad subject\narea related to bill: TV, with instruction, and radio, with instruction. NAEB\nPresident Harley and Counsel Jorgensen should probably be present throughout.\nEach witness should support bill in general, refering to \"NAEB position. \"\nEach witness should speak further to specific of bill re his subject or georgraphic\narea. Essentially, NAEB must take position that it speaks more broadly to bill\nthan any other single organization. We must make full case, albeit augmented by\nothers we know likely to testify from their own specific point of view. Ours\nis the total definitive \"educational broadcasting\" position on an educational broadÂ¬\ncasting bill. Others can individually strengthen their own particular sub-category\nof the total field. We must assert this, and stick to it!"
