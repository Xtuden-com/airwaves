(Reference: Jorgensen, Satellite filing. )\nWe must now look to those exhibits and arguments which would most\nstrengthen those conclusions at which we must arrive from the number of conflicting\nprevious points. We must then determine which witnesses will carry the burd ~n\nwhich testimony and be available for questioning under which major sections of this\noverall approach. Only then would we be able to make intelligent arrangements of\nour witnesses and testimonies. V/e must also assume for the most part the points\nthat we make will be made by nobody else except in the most general terms. We\nfurther must recognize that not all of us in the various components of educational\nbroadcasting will agree as organizations or as individuals. We already have heard\nthat William Henry may disagree with us on the method of selection of members of\nthe Board of the Corporation although I'm not sure he knows what we recommend,\nnevertheless we must assume that he will have to feel free to disagree.\nIn any event, we must make every effort to come up with an absolutely\nconsistent overall NAEB agreement on all of the preceding arguments and inte-\npretations. If this is not possible we must speak to them with precisions or\notherwise."
