  "text": "Dear Congressman Broyhill:\nAs you requested, I am sending to each member of the House\nCommittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce a copy of the\nNAEB memorandum prepared in connection with the Senate\nhearings on S. 1160. It relates to the definition of such\nterms as \"network\" and \"interconnection,\" about which there\nseems to be some misconceptions. Clarifying these points is\nimportant because the role of the proposed Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting is central to the purpose of the legis¬\nlation.\nLet me again emphasize that this legislation is not designed\nto establish, nor would it permit, a Federal national broad¬\ncasting network. The Corporation will not have a staff of\nproducers, commentators, or announcers; it will not have at\nits disposal a 24-hour leased-line interconnection system\nover which a regular schedule of its programs would be fed;\nit will not own or operate production equipment, studios, or\ninterconnection facilities; it will not have station \"affiliates\"\nwhich are essential to any systematic networking operation;\nand it will not and cannot produce or distribute programs\nitself. Instead, it must arrange with others for the perfor¬\nmance of such activities.\nWhat the Corporation will do is provide support for helping\nto improve and expand the programming and distribution\nactivities of existing (and future) educational stations and\nstate, regional, and national networks - each of which has its\nown autonomous Board of Trustees and staff. (Attached is a list\nof 13 regional and national program services and networks.)"
