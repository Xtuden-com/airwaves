Concerned about educational aspects of public\ntelevision and little impressed with its attempt to raise\nsin cultural level. Main concern is with \"what kinds of\nprogramming do you intend to produce with public corp moneies?\"\nFuzzy answers won't work. Knows the field, and demands\nstraightforward, honest replies.\nDAN KUYKENDALL Tenn\nProbably notunftendly, but doubtful if he woudl defy party\nline if it came to that. (Pronounced XKXX& \"Kirkendall\" by\nthe way.) With ref to editorializing, wonders if new an regs\nby FCC, specifically aimed at regulating this aspect of ETC,\nare required."
