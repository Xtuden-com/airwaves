Magnuson\nSenate Office Building\nWashington, D.C. 20510\nDear Senator Magnuson:\nMy wife and l should like to urge full support for Senate bill $.1160\n(PUBLIC BROADCASTING ACT G- 1967). We see the passage of this act\nas am important step forward in the area of educational broadcasting.\nUnlike many, we do not oppose additional taxation if tnese funds\nare used constructively rather than desrructively (we are strongly opposed\nto the U.S. aggression in VIET NAM). This act is an excellent example\nof the kind of project that should be supported by federal funds.\nYours truly,\nArthur P. Jacoby"
