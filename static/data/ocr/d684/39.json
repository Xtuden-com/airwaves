Ray Blanton\nThe United States Congress\nHouse of Representatives\nWashington, D. C. 20002\nDear Congressman Blantons\nThere is presently before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign\nCommerce bill H.R. 6736 for action by the House on S. 1160, The\nPublic Broadcasting Act of 1967, passed by the Senate. You are\nperhaps aware of the efforts during the past five years to establish\na state wide system of educational television stations, some of\nwhich are already on the air. There is a great deal yet to be done\nin this area alone.\nThere is presently under way a study toward establishing a state\nnetwork of educational radio stations in Tennessee. This study is\nbeing conducted by the University of Tennessee under the sponsorÂ¬\nship of various educational institutions from across the state,\nrepresented in your district by .Memphis State University, Christian\nBrothers College and Freed Hardeman College (the latter placed\nstation WFHO-FM in operation last month).\nRepresentatives of these and other educational institutions in\nTennessee met in Nashville in January of this year to initiate this\nstudy and informally organized themselves into the Tennessee\nEducational Broadcasters Association for the purpose of establishing\nthe Tennessee Educational Radio Network. The purpose of the study\nis to determine the specific needs of the State for an educational\nradio network with recommendations for location in areas not now\nbeing served and programming to be presented. There is much work\nto be done and much financial assistance will be needed.\nThe Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 will provide assistance in this\nproject. We urge you to make a special effort to see that your\ncommittee and the House take action on this bill in the present\nsession and that the needs of Tennessee are included in the final\nlegislation.\nYours sincerely.\nAlvin L. Bolt, Supervising\nAudio-Visual Librarian and\nMgr. of Radio Station WFLN\nALB/ab"
