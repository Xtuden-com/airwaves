  "text": "QUESTIONS AND ISSUES ABOUT THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING ACT\n(References are to S.1160 voted by the Senate\non May 17, 1967)\n1. Does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lead to\ngovernment control of broadcasting?\nNo. The government already licenses broadcasting stations\nthrough the Federal Communications Commission; nothing\nin present proposals changes that relationship. To avoid\ngovernment control'of programs the bill provides for a\nsystem of checks and balances that apportions responsibility\namong the Public Corporation's Board of Directors, the\nCongress, the President, and most importantly, the stations\nthemselves which retain the option to make all their own\nprogram decisions.\n2. Does the President's power to appoint the Board of\nDirectors make this Public Corporation a political instrument?^\nNo. The President appoints only nine of the fifteen\ndirectors and those nine must be confirmed by the Senate.\nThrough a rotation of tenure, terms of a majority of the\ndirectors will always extend beyond presidential tenure.\n3. Does government assistance to educational broadcasting\nhurt the commercial broadcasting business?\nNo. Experience shows that the addition of good educational\nbroadcasting services in a community do not diminish the\nmass audiences to which commercial entertainment programs\nare directed. The present effort is not to develop programs\nthat will duplicate the nppegjr g£ ~£&uil\ncommercial programs but to pr ov rdriTforth^ American public\nan additional range of prn JC\\i m i.\n4. Will the Public Broadcasting Act inhibit the development\nof UHF and FM^\nNo. In,fact, the evidence suggests that commercial UHF and\nFM operators benefit from the existence of educational UHF\nstations which have helped to increase the number of^ail-\nchannel receivers and which have stimulated interest in\nviewing UHF ■ ■ oham-ie-irs"
