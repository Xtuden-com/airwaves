  "text": "The Editor\nThe Washington Post\nWashington, D. C.\nDear Sir:\nThe Post's editorial on May 14, endorsing the main principles\nof the Public Television Act will add important support to\nthis unique legislation. However, it misses the opportunity\nto reinforce the Senate Commerce Committee's amendment of the\nbill calling for a Public Broadcasting concept.\nThe Senate Committee's change in the title of the bill and\nthe name of the Public Corporation recognizes that radio and\ntelevision should be seen as complementary resources that must\nboth be used fully to meet the varied educational, cultural,\nand social demands of our society.\nThe Senate bill, as amended, corrects the inappropriate\nomission of radio and the potential for educational broadÂ¬\ncasting to serve through both its media is considerably\nenhanced by the conceptual implications of their amendments.\nBoth the problems and the promise that the Post anticipates\nfor television also relate to radio, not because the media\nare identical, but because together they represent a total\npotential for service that can not be fulfilled by either\none alone.\nSincerely yours.\nWGH:mab\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident"
