My Committee began hearings on S. 1160 and\nother similar measures today. I believe that teleÂ¬\nvision has tremendous potential as an instrument of\neducation and we should encourage its full development.\nI plan to testify in support of my bill before\nthe Committee and you may be sure that I will work to\npersuade all the Members of my Committee to report this\nlegislation favorably.\nWarmest regards\nSNF:amh"
