C.\nDear Senator Pastors:\nThis letter is written by the NAEB in response to in¬\nquiries made during recent hearings on S. 1160, regarding the\noperational functions of the Corporation for Public Television.\nAs a result of meetings among representatives of the Carnegie\nCommission, National Educational Television and the NAEB, ar¬\nranged pursuant to a Committee suggestion, all parties agreed\nto the following statement, which was submitted by Dr. Killian:\nThe ultimate responsibility for interconnec¬\ntion for national program distribution must\nrest with the Corporation.\nIn exercising this responsibility, the Corp¬\noration clearly has the option of choosing\namong several methods. It might appoint an\nadvisory committee, including representatives\nof local educational broadcast stations, to\nsuggest to it policies for the handling of\ninterconnection or to review the inter¬\nconnection decisions which it had made over\na stated period. As another approach, the\nCorporation might exercise its interconnec¬\ntion responsibility by special contractual\narrangements. It might wish to aid in the\nformation of a new organization or advisory\ngroup, including representatives of the local\nstations and the program suppliers, to handle\nday-to-day decisions on interconnection. What¬\never special administrative arrangements are\nmade by the Corporation in exercising its op¬\ntion, however, it must retain ultimate respon¬\nsibility.\nThe following NAEB comments are offered in the light of\nthe foregoing statement:"
