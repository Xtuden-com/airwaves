Schooley\nRadio Station WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Schooley:\nPlease accept my thanks for your letter of\nOctober 2 with its comments on the report on ’’Central Sound\nSystems for Schools”. Your comments were exactly of the\nspecific type which are most helpful.\nIn a letter which I received today from the\nFederal Recorder Company, there is the following paragraph:\n”As I mentioned over the telephone, we found ourselves\nunable to establish connections with the N.A.E.B., in\norder to have tests made of our equipment. At the time\ntests were being conducted, we were unfortunately in the\nprocess of changing models, and at the same time, we were\nchanging the location of our manufacturing plant. For\nthat reason, you will find that on Page 34, our models are\nnow listed with incorrect prices and model names.”\nI shall appreciate it if you will let me know\ner that is a correct statement of the situation with\nct to the Federal Recorder.\nSincerely yours.\nIrvin Stewart,\nDirector"
