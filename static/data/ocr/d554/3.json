A. James Ebel. My own knowl¬\nedge is non-technioal but Judging from the tests\nmade for us by Mr. Ebel on recording equipment\nand by the comments made by recording engineers\nwho have been here with equipment, I feel sure\nhe is purely scientific in his methods. In fact,\nIt was our desire to have scientific data on\nrecording equipment for our own station that has\nled to the NAEB tests.\nSincerely yours,\nFES: EH\nEno.\nFrank E. School©y"
