Moreover, even daytime programs presented during the summer months\nmust \"be discontinued with the approach of winter and a shorter broadcast day.\nThe experience.of Station T'JKAR is typical. At a time when these programs would\nhe of most value to shippers, Station TJKAR had to curtail its early morning\nbroadcasts of market information (R. 6127). The Farm Radio School which used\nto be.broadcast during evening hours, had to be shifted to early morning, and\neventually;discontinued.\nThe question naturally arises: What is the rule which prevents listeners\nin the various cities and states in which HAEB stations are located, from hear¬\ning the programs of such unique and local interest during nighttime hours?\nThe answer is: The clear channel doctrine vhich reserves certain channels\nfor the exclusive nighttime use of only one station in the entire country.\nSince a number of HAEB,stations are licensed to ooerate daytime,only on clear\nchannels, they are required to sign off at local sunset or at sunset at the\ndominant station. The resu.lt is, for example, that Station HOI, Ames, Iowa\nand WAD, Horman, Oklahoma, cannot operate at night because of protection af¬\nforded to the signal of Station KFI, Los Angeles, California, in areas hun¬\ndreds of miles from Los Angeles, Stations WHCU, Ithaca, Hew York, and WAR,\nEast Lansing Michigan, cannot operate at night because they are required to\nprotect the signal of Station Tf-JL, Hew Orleans, Louisiana, hundreds of miles\nfrom Hew Orleans. Stations WCAL, Horthfield, Minnesota, and EUOM, Minneapolis,\nMinnesota, cannot operate nighttime because they protect the signal of Station\nWJZ, Hew York City, hundreds of miles from Hew York, Station HOSU, Columbus,\nOhio, cannot operate nighttime because of protection afforded to the signals"
