Our investigation leads us to believe that there will be\npractically no serious interference with the rights of present broadcasters.\nOur study of European conditions and plans leads us to believe that this\ncombination which we suggest will give America the best system in the world, a\nsystem where the defects of one particular portion are counterbalanced and offset\nby the advantages in another part, and we ask you in behalf of the American\nlisteners to give this proposal most serious consideration.\nWe believe that you have before you and in your hands a resource more potent\nfor the welfare of America than anything that has appeared since the establishment\nof printing. This resource is greater in its implications, in its reach, in its\npossible effect upon the information, the attitudes, and the judgments of the\npeople, than even the press. We believe that the same principles which were\nadopted *y America in assuring the freedom of the press should be adopted in\nthis new means of communication.\nooooOooooo\n-14-"
