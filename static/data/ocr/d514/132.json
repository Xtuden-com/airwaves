In addition to the speeches, I think a brief message from the\nMSB president should he included explaining that the PORTFOLIO was\nprepared by the public relations committee as a member service to serve\nas an aid in preparing speeches, etc.In the explanation we might\nadd that some of the speeches are a bit dated and the information will\nhave to continue to be up-dated to remain accurate.\nI am enclosing, too, a director/ which Elmer Busier sent for our\npossible use. To prepare a booklet like this for available KASB speakers\nwould be a tremendous job...I could supply possibilities from Detroit and\nother cities in Michigan but certainly lack the information about the\nentire F. 3. If you know of speakers across the States and would like to\nprepare a list, by States, feel free. But I doubt if it would have enough\nuse to warrant the time invested in its preparation.\nI*m anxious to see how both the PR KIT and SPEAKERS' PORTFOLIO look\nwith all the materials In them. They are certainly a valuable member\nservice and I hop the members' response will justify the many hours we\nhave spent preparing then. We are certainly grateful for your time and\neffort, Betty. Neither the KIT nor the PORTFOLIO would be possible\nwithout your skills.\nWith all good wishes.\nMarion Cornell, Manager\nEducational Television\nMCrda\ncc; Harold Hill"
