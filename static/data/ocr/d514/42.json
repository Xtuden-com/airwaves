In developing this\nreorganization the NAEB Washington office has suggested\nthat it handle its own efforts toward the establishment\nof a public relations department within the organization.\nWhile I am no longer a member of the NAEB Public\nRelations Committee, your Committee may be open to an\noccasional suggestion. If so, may I suggest that you\nlook into the possibility of exhibit space in the\nCommunications Center which is being erected at the\nNew York Worldfs Fair! To the best of my knowledge,\nthis would be the first time for a great mass of people\nin the United States could be informed of what educ¬\national television is, does, and plans to do.\nAnytime I can be of assistance to you, be certain\nto call on me.\nLou Peneguy, Director,\nCoordination and Information\nLP/pb\nccs Mr. Harold Hill\nThe Nation’s first ETV network telecasts simultaneously over four channels. Programming is originated by Auburn University, the Bir¬\nmingham Area Educational Television Association, the University of Alabama (which is also a NET affiliate), and CBS-TV and NBC-\nTV documentary programs and educational telecourses."
