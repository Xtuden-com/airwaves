  "text": "Page 2\nMrs. Betty McKenzie\nI made my suggestions for the format of each speech in a previous\nletter. In addition to the speeches, I think a brief message from the\nNAIB president should be included explaining that the PORTFOLIO was\nprepared by the public relations committee as a member service to serve\nas an aid in preparing speeches, etc..In the explanation we might\nadd that some of the speeches are a bit dated and the information will\nhave to eeatinne to be up-dated to remain accurate.\nI m enclosing, too, a directory which Elmer Busier sent for our\npossible use. To prepare a booklet like this for available NA1B speakers\nwould be a tremendous job...I could supply possibilities from Detroit end\nother cities in Michigan but certainly lack the information about the\nentire U. S. If you know of speakers across the States and would like to\nprepare a list, by States, feel free. But I doubt if it would have enough\nuse to warrant the time invested in its preparation.\nI'm anxious to see how both the PR KIT and SPEAKERS1 PORTFOLIO look\nwith all the materials in them. They are certainly a valuable member\nservice and I hop the members' response will justify the many hours we\nhave spent preparing them. We are certainly grateful for your time end\neffort, Betty. Keither the KIT nor the PORTFOLIO would be possible\nwithout your skills.\nWith all good wishes.\nMCida\nMarion Cornell, Manager\nEducational Television\ncc: Harold Hill"
