Seme do belong to the MB, as well as the state broad¬\ncasting groups, but others do not—in sane cases, because of financial\ninability.\nYes, I am familiar with the SPEAKERS GUIDE provided by the NAB.\nI think it is a wonderful service and I firmly believe that a similar\nguide for members of the MAEB would be of great benefit to members.\nHowever, the preparation of such a guide would take a considerable\namount of time and although I am willing and eager to help, the amount\nof time I can pledge for such an endeavor might not be adequate to get\nthe job done*\nI am planning to be in Indianapolis September 29 and 30 to attend\nour East Central Area Fall Conference of American Women in Radio and\nTelevision* It Blight be possible to arrive early enough on the 29th\nto allow time for a conference with you on NAEB public relations possi¬\nbilities meantime, all the best * * *\nCordially,\nMD:da\nMarion Cornell, Manager\nEducational Television"
