Does anyone have the responsibility\nof chairman or how do we set the wheels in motion? I had a letter\nfrom Harold Hill a few weeks ago telling me of my appointment as a\nmember of your committee and 1 suspect further details will be forth*\ncoming from someone as to our next move.\nX believe this is my first experience in working directly with you as\na committee menfcer but I am sure I am going to enjoy it. X am looking\nforward to seeing you at the JWRT Convention in May.\nBest wishes always.\nSincerely yours.\n(Mrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nEducations! Media Specialist\nec: Mr. Harold Hill"
