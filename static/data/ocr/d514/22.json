  "text": "Miss Corwell\nMarch 20, 1962\n2\nI think, lay in the fact that NAEB did a imprrrtnnt fthinQB, but\ndid no one thing immediately identifiable as its reason for existence.\nAt past sessions of the PR Committee I made the suggestion that we\nneeded a clear-cut statement of PR objectives. We were at the time\nconcerned^with production of materials -- a decal, for example. As vou\nwellJbmw^-.,PE. okj-ectives derive from tihe fumrtion of Q^ganlzation.\nThe PR Committee was pretty hazy on the function of NAEB.\nAll of which brings me back to the promotion spots for \"Family Living.\"\nPeople in educational broadcasting deal most of the time with people\nwho are aware of the possibilities of educational broadcasting. This\ncan lead to a point of view which assume broader interest than actually\nexists. For the past six months I have been dealing with people who\nnever heard of NAEB, who think of educational broadcasting as a \"Know\nYour Schools\" program on the local station. To them NAEB is some kind\nof highly specialized organization which is pretty remote from their\nevery day problems.\nMany of the individual projects of NAEB have immediate bearing on the\nproblems of these people. If they live in areas served by educational\nstations there is a chance for NAEB to influence them through programs.\nBut if they react to content of programs, feel some identification with\nthe local educational station, they're doing pretty well.\nI don't mean that I think NAEB should pass up opportunities to use such\nchannels as \"Family Living\". But I feel at present as though we have a\nunwieldy mass of information which must somehow be unified and related\nto concerns of the public.\nIf you don't have anything that does the job I would be willing to give\nit another try, but I can't promise anything.\nBest regards\nDirector of Public Relations\nRF: vd"
