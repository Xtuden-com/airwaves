W.\nWashington 6, D* G.\nDear Harold:\nThis letter was originally started right after I received the check covering\nray expenses to the NAEB Seminar. This time I hope I can finish it. I\nappreciated your remunerating me so promptly for my travel expenses to the\nSeminar. As always, it was a real pleasure seeing you again and I felt the\nweek in Virginia was certainly worthwhile.\nSince returning, I have been attempting to get some material together to\nimplement Public Relations suggestions made by our ad hoc Coramettee.\nWhat do you think of the following for a statement of purpose for the Public\nRelations Committee?—\nEstablish, implement, and maintain a long-range program designed\nto assure recognition of the existence, purposes, and activities\nof the NAEB, its member-stations, and individual members.\nCreate within the NAEB, the consciousness that members belong to\na significant organization.\nAdvise the National Board on specific problems it may refer to\nthe committee.\nBe available for personal courtesies and assistance on behalf of\nthe organization to visitors — especially those from abroad.\nAs requested by the Board, prepare printed brochures and pamphlets\nfor publication, in cooperation with the publications editor.\nI have also written a paragraph describing the nature of the Naeb which e©uld\nbe distributed to 41 member stations with the suggestion that it be included\nat the end of every news release, a long with the statement that the station\nis an active member of the NAEB. I believe it should be included in the PR\nkit:"
