We\ncould prepare something similar which I believe would take care of many\nof your suggestions. Let me know as soon as possible what you think of\nthis idea, and meanwhile I will write to Betty McKenzie and see if we\ncan dig up enough money to publish enough copies for our membership. And\nalso, how far would you be willing to go in working on such a guide?\n(You see, I have a lot of confidence in your abilities.)\nI just wish that it would be possible for us to get together one of these\ndays and have time to discuss some of these matters in detail. Very con¬\nfidentially, I take a rather dim view of the PR abilities of several of\nour members thisjear. In fact, I have a hunch that when the powers that\nbe decide to place our new NAEBers in an activity, they throw them into\nthe Public Relations committee.\nI will look forward to hearing from you and meanwhile, please accept ray\nthanks for your most valuable cooperation.\nElmer G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGSjvz"
