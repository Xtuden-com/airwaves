Harley\n3 National Association of\nl Educational Broadcasters\nSuite 1119\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D* C.\nDear Bill:\nThank you for your letter and the enclosed memoÂ¬\nrandum concerning the purpose of NAEB. It is well\nwritten and will be of great help in our attempt to\nsuccinctly describe the image of NAEB*\nI enjoyed our brief visit and the opportunity to\ndiscuss the formation of the public relations committee.\nI would still very much like to know what is expected of\nthe committee. Are we to concern ourselves at all with\npublicity, or is this handled exclusively by a staff\nmember of the National Headquarters? Just as soon as I\nreceive information concerning the committee members I\nwill go into action.\nYou should be hearing from the Dearborn Inn any\nday and I will be interested to know your plans for the\nEducational Media Council.\nCordially,\nMarion Corwell, Manager\nEducational Television\nMC:da"
