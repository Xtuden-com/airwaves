This was done, as you probably recall, in order\nto get some idea of how many we should have done—and whether we can\nafford to have the covers printed.\nDotty tells me we are still getting letters in reply—but so far the\ntotals are: PR kit - 290? speaker's guide - 98. These figures include\nseveral large \"orders.\" 41 people wrote about the PR kit—and 5 of\nthese asked for a total of 202, while the other 36 asked for a total\nof 88. 35 people wrote about the speaker's guide—and 1 asked for 20.\nSo I suppose we'll have to set some kind of limit.\nDick says we can have the printed covers for about a nickel apiece—\nand I think we ought to do them. If we print 500 of each, this would\ncost us $50. All of the inside matter can be mimeogaphed. (According\nto the figures, perhaps we only need about 200 speaker's guides.)\nWhat do you think? As soon as I get the go-ahead from you, I'll start\nhaving them printed...and then, if we can get the insides done, perhaps\nthey'll be ready to announce at the convention. I don't, however, think\nthey should be distributed there, as I think there's a better chance of\nthem being used if they're mailed to the member direct.\nC Marion has put in a lot of thought and effort on these, and I hope\nthey will look good and be distributed in such a manner that they'll\nbe used as intended. (Here I'm twisting your arm to try to get you to\nlet us have the covers printed. At least I'm not devious about it!)\n>l(XyT4Jl<L -\n4ok ^ ft?
