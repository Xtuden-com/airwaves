HEH read; said it was too short and besides he didn't like it; do it\nover.\n4. BMCK lengthened it and rewrote it and sent a ditto'd copy to PR\ncommittee members, asking them to read and make suggestions and return\nso BMCK could have suggestion on HEH's desk by 4/16.\n5. So far, today (4/11/62) one comments has been received hereâ€”from\nTom Aylward who says he'll buy it as it is...and adds: \"All I want to\nknow is how the he., can a committee write a one-minute spot? From this,\nit appears possible; seems incredible.\" So I think we sold him on committee\naction anyway.\n6. Today BMCK receives a note from Mary Lynn saying HEH aays to go ahead\nand write the gu^. with a copy to HEH.\nn ode\n7. BMCK will do, after allowing sufficient time for other PR committee\nmembers to protest or suggest.\nP.S. No, HEH dddn't leave the original copy of this letter with me.\nHe did, however, leave a carbon copy of it."
