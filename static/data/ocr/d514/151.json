Inter¬\nnational.\nRECOMMENDATION\nThe committee supports the recommendation of the Airlie House Seminar that\na Publicity Committee be formed, with the chairman serving as vice chariman of\nthe Public Relations Committee, and vice versa. This arrangement would serve as a\ncohesive force in the functioning of these committees; the added manpower would\nmake it possible for assignments to be carried out which have heretofore been\nimpossible. Publicity does the communicating for an organization and this is a\nvital area which should not be neglected in future NAEB planning."
