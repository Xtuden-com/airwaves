Community Service\nActivities, called for wider voluntary and\ngovernment backing of the arts. He noted\nthat automation and the shorter work week\nare leaving “millions of workers with leisure\ntime on their hands.”\nMore important, the labor union official\ntook direct action. In a letter to Lyman S.\nFord, executive director of the United Com¬\nmunity Funds and Councils of America,\nPerlis called upon this group, the national\nassociation of local community chests, to\n“explore the possibilities of raising funds\nlocally to help support art exhibits, sym¬\nphony concerts, opera, the legitimate the¬\natre, etc.”\nThe Perlis suggestion carries special force\nbecause organized labor is represented in\nthe top councils of the U.C.F.C.A. Joseph\nBeirne, president of the Communications\nWorkers of America, is chairman of the\nexecutive committee of the fund raising asso¬\nciation, and labor unions are credited with\nraising $166,000,000 of the $498,000,000 col¬\nlected last year by U.C.F.C.A. affiliates.\nLocal community chest contributions to\ncultural institutions—mostly museums and\nlibraries—are extremely limited. A Septem¬\nber, 1961 survey reveals that, of 460 local\ncommunity fund organizations, only 21 lent\naid to the arts. Their total giving to cultural\norganizations ran to $170,000.\nU.C.F.C.A. estimates that nationwide chest\ncontributions to the arts are approximately\n$1,000,000. This is only .2 per cent of the\ntotal amount collected by U.C.F.C.A. affili¬\nates. The remaining 99.8 per cent goes\nlargely to health, welfare and educational\ngroups. The Perlis action, if backed by\nlabor’s influence within U.C.F.CA., could\nlift the arts percentage appreciably.\nMeanwhile, there is evidence that labor\nunions, themselves, will offer financial sup¬\nport for the arts, if properly approached. In\nWashington recently, Mrs. Jack Coopersmith,\npresident of the Washington Civic Opera\nAssociation, received a $1,080 labor con¬\ntribution. This donation paid for a second\nperformance of Hansel and Gretel for chil¬\ndren turned away from a jammed hall dur¬\ning the only scheduled performance of the\nHumperdinck classic. The gift came from\nthe 400,000-member Retail Clerks Interna¬\ntional Association. It took a single phone\ncall and a brief visit with R.C.I.A. president\nJames Suffridge to arrange the contribution.\nMrs. Coopersmith has since found that la¬\nbor’s generosity was contagious. She told\nArts Management: “At the second program,\ntwo officials of labor unions and one from\na department store came up to me and\nasked what they could do to help the opera\nassociation. This experience has been an\nexcellent beginning, and I think it should\nbe possible to get labor support of the\narts everywhere.”\nMr. Suffridge and the union he heads have\ntaken an interest in community-service work\nfor years. The union president told Arts\nManagement: “If there are similar situations\n(please turn to page jour)\nFoundations, due to give away $625,000,-\n000 in 1962, turn down 96 per cent\nof all applications for grants. This striking\nstatistic indicates that many appeals to them\nare not merely badly conceived, but also\nmisdirected and/or poorly presented.\nIn making an approach to any founda¬\ntion, cultural organizations should take the\nsame professional attitude as that exhibited\nby the educational, health and social wel¬\nfare groups that win the lion’s share of\nfoundation money.\nThe primary step must be the careful\nchoice and delineation of the project to be\nsupported. It should be timely, important,\nand something that your institution could not\nfinance in any other way.\nThe next step is painstaking research into\nthose foundations that are possible sources\nof support for the project. Not till are. At\nthe end of 1961 there were some 13,000\nfoundations in the U.S., and Internal Revenue\nNUMBER 1 • FEBRUARY 1962\nAM SURVEY\nThe Arts Get a Free Ride\nOn Public Transit Systems\nFree advertising space on public\ntransportation vehicles is available to\ncultural institutions and groups in 38\nof 57 cities responding to a survey\njust completed by Arts Management.\nSpace for displaying posters in busses,\nsubways and streetcars can be ob¬\ntained at a fraction of its regular\ncost in 18 reporting cities. Only one\ntransit advertising company in a\nsingle city flatly refused to offer spe¬\ncial treatment to cultural institutions.\nMembers of the National Associa¬\ntion of Transit Advertising, Inc., rep¬\nresenting about three-fourths of the\ntotal transit advertising volume in\nthe U.S., indicated a marked willing¬\nness to cooperate with arts groups.\nMany cautioned, however, that free\nspace for poster cards is available\nonly under certain conditions.\nThe first is that there be vacant\nspace. In the words of one leading\ncompany, “Our ability to accommo¬\ndate institutions . . . depends on\nspace availabilities. Our principal\nbusiness is to sell the advertising\nspace at the full rate to regular\nadvertisers.”\nNearly all those offering special\nconsideration to cultural groups also\nspecify that they must be non-profit\nin character.

Moreover,\nnot all of the new foundations coming up\nare small ones. The record shows that in\n1945 there were only five U.S. foundations\nwith assets of $50,000,000 or more; today\nthere are 27.\nGenerally, larger national foundations\nlike Ford and Rockefeller prefer to aid\n“risk ventures”—new departures in the\ngrant recipient’s field of endeavor. They\nview their grants as “seed money”, and only\nrarely grant funds for maintenance needs\nor similar routine demands.
