I hope you had a wonderful\ntime*\nNo I didn*t receive, so far, any response at all from my printed\nrequest for speeches. I suspect we won't get any since people have\nhad plenty of time to react if they were going to. Actually I did¬\nn't have very high hopes of our getting anything, but thought there\nwas a slight possibility that someone might know of just the right\nspeech to cover one of the topics.\nThe little note in the Newsletter asking people whether they would\nuse the PR Kit and Speaker's Guide is having somewhat different re¬\nsponse. Since this was in the August Newsletter, and people have\nbarely had time to read it and reply, it seems that there is a real\nneed for this kind of thing because we already have a number of re¬\nquests for it.\nI hope your letter to Hank Mamet nets the other items for the kit.\ng_\nNow I just hope ym* can have them ready for convention time.\nBest,\n(Mrs.) Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMCK/mp\nOffices at 59 East Armory, Champaign, Illinois"
