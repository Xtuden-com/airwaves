However, I think these will still\nbe of some value to people who have to make speeches and need\nquick documentation of ideas.\nIt was good to see you in Philadelphia. I think as Chairman of\nthe Public Relations Committee you made some positive contributions\nto the NAEB program. Which is certainly more than past committees\nhave done.\nBest regards\nRoy Flynn \\\nDirector of Pdblic Relations\nRF: vd\nEnclosures"
