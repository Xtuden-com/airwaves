Hogan.\n\"Generally speaking, an individual joins an associat ion for two reasons:\nfor what he can get, and for what he can give.\n\"The first is a self-interest motive — he knows he* 11 learn more about\nhis business, he'll share ideas with competitors, he'll enjoy the good\nfellowship of people in a like situation, he'll have some of''his problems\nsolved, he'll be able to take advantage of research v)ork and stat isti-\ncal data and he'll benefit from all the services which your association\nrenders*\n\"The second motivation is to make a contribution toward enhancing the\nindustry's business potential and to improve the service being rendered\nto the public.\"\n\"...•To satisfy the man who wants to make an effective contribution to\nthe betterment of his industry , you must give him a chance to serve\non a committee whose scope of activities relates to his par ticular\ninterests. (This is extremely important. A great many members are lost\nbecause they have the feeling that they are not needed, or because they\nare not given the opportunity to work for the association.)\"\n\"Take credit for your accomplishments. Publicize your good works in\nyour magazines and newsletters, in personal letters, in speeches at\nregional meetings, in press releases to general circulation media as\nwell as to the specialized media serving your industry, in presentat ions\nby the head staff man or your president at convent ions — through every\nmedium at your disposal, tell your story. Tell it often and tell it wel.\nTake advantage of the advanced techniques which public relations offers\nyou.\""
