C.\nDear Bills\nThank you for your letter and for the photostats of\nEd Browned comments *\nX agree wholeheartedly with all of Ed’s suggestions\n-just about everything he mentions points up the necessity\nfor employing a full-time PE director assigned to NAE8 Head¬\nquarters. There are mway things I know Should be done for\nNAEB, and as PE Chairman, I am constantly frustrated because\nmy primary responsibilities here at the Museum have to come\nfirst* There is never enough remaining time to do the PR\njob that should be done for NAEB.\nMaybe this situation can be Improved in the future\nplanning of NAKB's growth.\nAll the best,\nMGida\nMarion Cornell, Manager\nEducational Television"
