HARLEY\nPRESIDENT\nAugust 3, 19 62\nMiss Marion Corwell\nHenry Ford Museum\nGreenfield Village\nDearborn, Michigan\nDear Marion:\nIt was good to hear your voice the other day. Be assured, I will be happy\nto lie through my pearly whites anytime a prospective employer inquires about\nyour competence in educational television.\nAs I indicated, I expect to be gone most of the month of August, but will\ncertainly be back by September lst--and possibly sooner. Please drop me a\ncard indicating the exact dates you will be in Washington. Letâ€™s not miss\neach other two years in a row!\nI am sending along photostats of a few pages of a memorandum which Ed\nBrowne has written in response to the Airle House comments . Since they refer\nprimarily to NAEB public relations, I thought they should be brought to your\nattention.\nCordially yours\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:pw\nEnclosure"
