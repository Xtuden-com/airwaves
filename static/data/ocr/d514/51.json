We\nneed to know so we can report to the NAEB Board May 1 in Columbus.\nThe last time I talked to Hank, he was having trouble with the artwork\nfor the cover of the kit, but you wrote since then to volunteer the\nhelp of your staff artist; so perhaps that has been solved.\nThen I believe you were handling the speaker's guides*..with Roy\nFlynn helping by providing quotes that might be contained therein.\nPerhaps we can show the Board what has been done to date, even if\nthe artwork isn't complete.\nWould you bring me up to date, please? Thanks.\nBest regards.\n(Mrs.) Bt\nPublications Editor\nBMC/dp\ncc: Harold E. Hill\nHenry Mamet\nRoy Flynn\nOffices at 59 East Armory, Champaign, Illinois"
