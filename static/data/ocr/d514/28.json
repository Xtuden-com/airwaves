So far\nas secretarial help is concerned, our present staff is overloaded, and\nit would be better if the grant could provide for one* However, it this\none stumbling block might be the difference between getting a full-time\nm person through a grant, or not getting one, we'd dig up the dough to\nhire some part-time secretarial help someway - but, as I say, it would\nbe better if the grant included such funds.\nSo - full-speed ahead, and more power to you, and again our apologies\nfor any delay we may have caused. And I'd appreciate your keeping me\ninformed of any progress. Bsrhaps Lou and I can discuss this at the\ntime of the Region II meeting is April.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEHrabt\ncc; Lou Beneguy"
