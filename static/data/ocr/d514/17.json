Cornell\nHenry Ford Museum and\nGreenfield Village\nDearborn, Michigan\nDear Marion:\nI have just had a copy of a letter from the Educational Media\nCouncil to the Dearborn Jhn indicating that because of the conflict\nin dates the Council will be unable to meet there.\nWhat is the Harlan House that you mention ? I know who\nAllen Harlan is, but I don't know anything about his house, Is this\na center of some kind on one of the universities' campuses in Detroit?\nI will pass along the material on the Fairlane Inn as soon as\nit arrives. I have a happy recollection of that establishment.\nHarold Hill has already written you, I believe, and you will be\nhearing more from him from time to time in connection with committee\nwork. You realize, I am sure, that I would prefer to correspond with\nyou myself but I have designated committee coordination as his special\nresponsibility. On the other hand, please don't hestitate to write me\ndirect if you have some particular question you would like to raise with\nme.\nI am going out to San Francisco the week of February 19th and\nplan to visit Madison enroute. It may be, therefore, that I would be\npassing through the airport at Detroit on February 20 or 21 and, if so,\nI will try and call you.\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH/vr"
