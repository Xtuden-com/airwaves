C.\nDear Bill*\nThank you for your letter and for the photostats of\nSd Browne1s comments.\nX agree wholeheartedly with all of Bd's suggestions\n——just about everything he mentions points up the necessity\nfor employing a full-time PH director assigned to HABB Head¬\nquarters. There are many things I know should be done for\nHABB, end as PH Chairman, I am constantly frustrated because\nmy primary responsibilities here at the Museum have to come\nfirst. There is never enough remaining time to do the PH\njob that should be done for NABB*\nMaybe this situation can be improved in the future\nplanning of MASB1* growth.\nAll the best,\nMarion Cornell, Manager\nEducational Television\nMC:da"
