Sulaer, Director\nRadio and Television Coanunieations\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nT* -\nDear Brosaoi\nSorry to disappoint you but I am afraid that while I am ’♦willing11 to\nundertake the chore of preparing news releases to local papers of\nmembers of various KAEB committees, it doesn’t seem to me wise to do\nthis right now# Why don’t we wait until the new committee members\nare appointed in January and then send these out for all committee\nmembers including the old ones? Since some of the papers to whom\nthese should go have received a Newsletter in which the committee\nmembers were listed, it might be gSISng the lily to issue ’♦news’*\nreleases now# I do think the idea is a good one and will follow\nthrough on it with the new year unless otherwise directed.\nI also think the idea of Marion* s of printing in the Newsletter\nfeature ©articles defining the duties and function of NAEB committees\nis a good one and will see what I can do in this regard.\nRegarding the Speaker’s Guide, this too seems like a fine suggestion\nbut the go-ahead on this will have to come from Harold because, as\nyou gather, this one would cost money#\nThank you for the compliment on my work#\nBest regards.\n(Mrs.) Betty\nPublications Editor\nBM3/dp\noos Miss Marion Corwell\nMr. Harold E. Hill"
