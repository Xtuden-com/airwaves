When we'll ever\nget the rest of them ready to be mailed, I don't\nknow...but we'll do so soon as possible. I'm\nquite pleased with this, but do have some mis¬\ngivings about the PR kit. It could have been so\nmuch better than it's going to be that I'm a\nlittle ashamed of it...but certainly neither\nyou nor I could take the time to do the whole\nthing alone; so we'll send out what we have and\nlet the chips fall.\nDotty Templeton, whom you may have met in Phila¬\ndelphia, and who is from our staff here, went\nin to the office Sat. and Sun. in Washington,\nright after we got back from Phila., and ran\nthe rest of these off on their oast mimeo machine,\npoor gal. And Butch, Harold Hill's 14-year-old\nsnn, went with her Sun. and helped pack the\nresults in her station wagon so we could bring\nit all back here. I should've been in there\nhelping, but had developed a heck of a cold\nright at the end of the convention, and really\ndidn't feel much like anything. So I'm afraid\nI let Dotty do all the work those days...\nHope all is well with you and your new job, and\nhope to see you again sometime soon....\n'j —."
