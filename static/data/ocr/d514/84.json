Hilliard\nDepartment of Radio* Television\nand Motion Picture®\nCommunication Center\nUniversity of North Carolina\nChapel Hill* North Carolina\nRegarding the AEJ convention again* would you do me another favor?\nX wrote to the ABJ to ask if we could have an exhibit* ami they\nreplied that arrangements have always been handled by the host college\nor university.*.and suggested that we contact Dean N. N. Luxon* of the\nSchool of Journalism there. Since It seems to me that we'd be mere\nlikely to receive a \"yes\" answer through personal contact, would you\nask him about It?\nOur problem la, as usual, money. Being nonprofit, ws don't have funds\nfor expenditures such as exhibits, though wo could pay a nominal sum.\nLots of times such associations as the AEJ have booths which nonlndus-\ntrlal nonprofit organisations can use free of coat, or at a nominal fee.\nUe really only need a small apace. The exhibit is a 3-panel ona, three\nfast tali and each panel two feet wide. This fits nicely on aatandard-\nslsod exhibit table. That, with another table for brochures and such,\nwould do nicely*\nthank for any help you ar» able to give ua on thU, onea again.\nCordially*\n(Mrs.) Betty MeKensU\nPublication® Editor\nBMC/dp\nblcc* Mr. Harold E.
