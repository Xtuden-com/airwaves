I just hope nothing happens\nso that we don't have them by then...but the\nprinterseems optimistic.\nThey should be very pretty...one will be black\non red, and the other one red on gray.\nIn order to be able to s£ford the price for\na good-looking cover, we willhave to mimeograph\nthe insides. I had hoped we might be able to\nmultilith it—but we can't.In fact, in order\nto be able to afford it, someone is going to\nhave to grind them out on our own mimeo machine\nin Washington—probably me, since I'll be there\nfor a day or two before and after the conven¬\ntion!\nAs far as what should be discussed at the PR\ncommittee meeting, I would suggest that you\nuse the Madison seminar recommendations in the\nPR area as a departure point—and figure out\nwhat we can do that hasn't been done, and how,\netc.\nSee you soon -"
