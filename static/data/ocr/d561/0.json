Since, however, channels 201 through 220 are not avail¬\nable for educational broadcasting in Alaska, some reasonable alternative\ntable for educational assignments in Alaska should be made.\nThe criterion relating number of assignments to community population sug¬\ngested in the Commission's Notice of Inquiry released on November 14, 1966\nwill be adequate and desirable for Alaska.\nThe size of Alaska communities in relation to the large sparsely populated\nareas aurrounding them indicate that the Commission should consider several\nclass C educational assignments in the commercial band for Alaska.\nThe Commission's proposals for more effective use of the spectrum through\nup-grading or elimination of 10 watt assignments is sound and commendable.\nThe University of Alaska supports proposals (1); (2); and (3) of para¬\ngraph 5 of the November 14 Notice.\nSigned:\nWilliam R. Wood\nPresident,\nUniversity of Alaska\nWRW/rvh\ncc: National Educational Radio"
