It is our opinion that too many of these stations\nfao.1 to acnieve their goal as an educational station, becoming\nmerely playthings for the personnel involved offering conteraoor-\nary and popular music for the entertainment of their audiences.\nWe feel that such a use of an educational channel is a waste of\nlicense and space on the dial.\n.>e hardily commend the Commission to review its policy on\neducational stations and to adopt a more stringent poiicy when\nrenewing licenses. We ash the Commission to examine the oro-\ngramming of these noncommercial stations when renewal of license\ncomes due and to issue renev;al based not on a strict outline of\npercentage of type of programs offered, but on the basis of whether\nthe station under scrutiny is fullfilling its obligations as an\neducational outlet to its audience.\nWe appreciate the interest of the Commission in the educaÂ¬\ntional radio field. We hope that we will be able to further aid\nthe Commission if possible.\nERS/rs\nCC:NAEB-Natl. Edu. Radio\n:Intercoll. Broad. System\nSincerely yours, ^\nEdward R. Sobel '\nStation Manager"
