Because of their comparatively limited\ncoverage area channels for these stations might well be contained in a block\nof frequencies without working hardship or causing interference.\n■Paragraph 6,page 3 speaks of 10-watt operations which for valid reasons are\npermitted to remain in operation. These could be shifted to the lower educa¬\ntional channels without prejudice, meanwhile maintaining existing co-channel\nand adjacent-channel mileage separation requirements*\nhe concur in the attitude expressed in paragraph 8,page that FM educational\nassignments be made irrespective of possible interference with television\ntranslators, since translators do not represent primary signal emission\nsources.\nhe can see no practical need to change the limitations on facilities\nand separation in the educational radio band, from those of the commercial\nfrequencies."
