Throughout\nits twelve years of broadcasting, KVOP-FM has provided\nan in-school program service to the El Paso Public School\nSystem between the hours of 9a.m. and 3:15p*^o> Monday\nthrough Friday. The hours from 3*15 through 10p.m. sign\noff have been used to provide realistic training in station\noperation for the Broadcasting majors of this institution.\nThe program service supplied by KVOF-FM is uniaue in this\narea and does not duplicate the programming of commercial\nFM stations. The college operates a carrier current system\nindependent of the FM station.\nWe object to the proposed rule making for the following\nreasons:\n1) Higher transmitter power will put us more\ndirectly into competition with local FM broadÂ¬\ncasters and might very well impair the\nexcellent relations existing between college\nand commercial broadcasters."
