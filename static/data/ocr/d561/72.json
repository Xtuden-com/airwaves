The last general survey, made in 1961-62, and\nbased on a four-page questionnaire mailed to 1,612 teachers in\nMinnesota schools, indicated a miniraum weekly audience of 2Gf0G0 and a\nmaximum audience of 39,500 regular in-school listeners. In 1965-66,\non the basis of 1,536 teachers* manuals sold, we estimate 53,760\nstudents, on the assumption that there are at least 35 pupils\nlistening for each teacher's manual. In addition to this, the\naudience for ”Letes Writs,*’ developed for the Minneapolis public\nschools, is reported by them as exceeding 8,000 students per week.\nA majority of the 800 tapes distributed by the Audio-Visual Extension\nService are of Minnesota School of the Air programs, and, even if\neach of these were played only once, it would reach a normal sized\nclass of soma thirty sutdents.\nMusic. KUOM has broadcast significant music regularly since\nthe 1920*s. Depending upon the sign-off hour, the station schedules\nfrom 13 to 30 hours of music each week.\nFrom 1938 until 1962, KCJOM broadcast all the Young People s\nConcerts of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra given in Minneapolis\nand St. Paul, as well as other concerts by the Orchestra. For several yaars\nin the late 1950*s„ recordings made at rehearsals were edited down\nfor a 45-minute concert preview on the day before each Friday evening\nsubscription concert. For several years in the late 1950ss, KUOM\nrecorded the Orchestra's Friday evening concerts for broadcast during\nthe summertime."
