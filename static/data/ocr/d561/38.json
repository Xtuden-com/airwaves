It\nis further requested that ten-wait educational stations be permitted to continue\ntheir present type of operation.\n(b) This Board of Education expresses its willingness to participate in\nfurther studies at the request of the Commission in attempt to find solutions\nto the problems of channel allocation, co-channel usage, the establishment of\nstate or regional networking arrangements and such other problems of mutual\nconcern to the general public, the Commission and the low-power educational EM\nradio broadcaster.\nRespectfully submitted,\nPaul C. Goodrich, Secretary\nBoard of Education, Twp. H. S.\nDistrict 203, Cook County, Illinois\nDated at Winnetka, Illinois,\nDecember 12, 1966"
