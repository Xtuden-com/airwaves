  "text": "Even though the station is student operated it is rigidly controlled by\na faoulty member who has had many years experience in both the technical\nand programming end of radio broadcasting and is operated with the highest\ntechnical standards*\nThe cost of the additional equipment required to inorease power to\nClass A. operation would in our case, be very difficult to meet at this\ntime, and I also fear that the competition for the limited number of\nchannels available would make it difficult for the small college to receive\nmuch consideration*\nThe suggestion that 10 watt FM stations be replaced by a oarrier-ourrent\nsystem is not very realistic* Our experience has shown that it is very\ndifficult to provide, an undistorted signal without exceeding the FCC radiation\nlimits. About one half of our student body lives off campus in fraternity\nhouses and other residences and would be out of reach of a carrier-current\nsystem*\nI would like to propose that at least one channel in the class A seotion\nbe reserved for 10 watt stations as I believe such stations are playing an\nimportant part in educational radio*\nSincerely,\nRaymond Cowan\nFaoulty Director WFCI-FM"
