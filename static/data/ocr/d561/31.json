As a new facility at ISU and in Bloomington-Normal we are\nstill seeking to discover ways in which we can be of service,\nand we intend to be looktog always for new ways to serve.\nIncreasing the power of our PM transmitter is a consideration for\nthe future. At present, we are still in the process of establishing\nradio e® this campus as a responsible educational tool and an academic\npursuit. Our students are not ready for additional responsibilities;\nour faculty and staff are not ready for immediate expansion. (Nor have\nwe included such expansion in our 1967-69 biennium budget proposals.)\nFor our students, for this University, and for our community—all of\nwhom we wish to serve—the educational, non-commercial 10 watt license\nwe now hold seems to be the laost practical and most useful facility for\nIllinois State University."
