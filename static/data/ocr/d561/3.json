Buzzard, Professor\nof Radio and T.V. at Phoenix College, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013. Mr. Buzzard's\nbackground is as follows:\nEducation: BA in Speech, Stats University of Iowa\nMA in Telecommunications, University of Southern California\nMED in Higher Education\nMS in Instructional Technology\nMr. Buzzard was instrumental in the building of WMCO-FM, Muskingum College,\nNew Concord, Ohio: KTXT-FM, Texas Technological College, Lubbock, Texas; and\nthe revitalizing of KFCA-FM, Phoenix College, Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Buzzard\nis a member of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, the\nAudio Engineers, International Platform Association, the Speech Association of\nAmerica, the Association for Professional Broadcast Education, and many other\norganizations in the field of broadcasting and education. Mr. Buzzard was\nassociated at one time with NBC in Hollywood.\nIt is felt that the pending rule change affecting the operation of 10\nwatt non-commercial educational FM stations has both advantages and disadvantÂ¬\nages.\nFirst, it is agreed that the operation of a 10 watt station, the 50 MVU\ncontour of which is approximately 2 miles in radius, is not necessarily good\nuse of the radio spectrum. In many cases, this type of station is operated\nwith the basic purpose of serving a limited area and to serve more would be a\nwaste of power. Examples of this are the many 10 watt stations in the Southern\nCalifornia metropolitan area. Currently, several would have to go off the\nair if the power requirements were increased. We are sure that the same\nconditions exist along the east coast."
