  "text": "16\nThe University of Minnesota alone, with its thousands of offerings\nin day school, evening classes, and correspondence study, and\ndrawing upon over tv/enty-five years experience in broadcasts\nfrom its own classrooms, is prepared to experiment extensively\nin developing credit courses for the general public as well as\nfor special interest groups. These would utilize not only the\nresources of the General Extension Division, but also of the\nUniversity's many other divisions and colleges.\nThe University of Minnesota, therefore, urges the Congress\nto provide funds with which to construct educational FM broadcasting\nfacilities. But for the absence of such funds, the University\nwould have constructed and operated an FM station long before now.\nBut confronted with requests from its many departments to support\ntheir varied and extensive activities, the University Administration\nhas been unable to find money for an FM radio station. When\nsupport becomes available, however, the University will construct\nand operate a station in the Minneapoiis/St. Pail area, drawing upon\nthe extensive resources of the Twin Cities in programming it. ThereÂ¬\nafter, the University will work cooperatively with other educational\ninstitutions, both public and private, to construct additional\ntransmitters elsewhere in Minnesota, together with studio facilities\nwhere required. These would be then used in developing a statewide\neducational FM service."
