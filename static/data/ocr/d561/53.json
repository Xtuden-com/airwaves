McKinley,Principal\nDecember 8, 1966\nMr. Jerrold Sandler\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n13a6 Connecticut Ave. N.W.\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Jerry,\nThanks so much for the \"care package\" you sent me\nNovember 10. I have been assured that our bill will be taken care\nof. The future of radio in little Muncie also looks bright. I have\nBEEN GIVING IN-SERVICE TRAINING TO TEACHERS IN THE USE OF THE RADIO\nAND ASSOCIATED SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. As ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY\nSUPERVISORS TOLD ME YESTERDAY, \"THE TEACHERS ARE REALLY *STEAMED\nUP* ABOUT USING THE RADIO AND RELATED MANUALS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.\"\nNOW WE COME TO POINT TWO! i, AS WELL AS YOU, HAVE RECEIVED\nMANY PANIC LETTERS CONCERNING THE RECENT FCC DOCKET No. 1*185.\nMost of the 10 watt stations feel that they will be forced off the\nair if this proposal passes. I AM personally against the proposal\nAND AM SENDING MY COMMENTS TO THE COMMISSION NEXT WEEK, AT LEAST\nBEFORE THE DEADLINE. FROM THE NER MEMORANDUM DATED NOV. 2^, SOME\nOF US HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT NER's SUPPORT OF THE 10 WATT STATIONS.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MEMORANDUM FROM NER SUPPORTING CONTINUATION\nOF THE TEN WATT STATIONS, IF THEY ARE TRULY OPERATING IN THE\nPUBLIC INTEREST AND PROVIDING AN EDUCATIONAL SERVICE IN KEEPING\nWITH THE ORIGINAL IDEA BEHIND THE TEN WATT STATION. I WOULD INVITE\nAN EARLY REPLY ON MY COMMENTS"
