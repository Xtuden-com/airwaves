Ickes\nFaculty Co-Sponsor, WOT\nNew frier Township High School\nWinnetka, Illinois\nDear Don:\nX don't know whether or not you bad had a chance to receive the copy of\nmy later-office memo or your copy of the attached memo to all radio sta¬\ntions from Jerry Sandler by the time you wrote your letter of November 27*\nAt any rate, as you know, the FCC *s concern, and our’s too, is with the\nwhole matter of FM allocations. This has been a problem far same time.\nNaturally, in considering the overall problem, the various components have\nto be taken into account — thus, the interest in what should be done, if\nanything, in connection with reservations fear 10 watt stations.\nOur staff is attempting to consider all aspects of the problem, and Jerry\nSandler, Jim Fellows (Assistant to the NAEB President), and I are meeting\nto discuss this at greater length tomorrow. Since I have resigned from\nthe NAEB as of the end of December (to accept a position at the University\nof Colorado in charge of all radio-television activities and as associate\nprofessor of speech), you might want to check with either Sandler or Fellows\non the progress of NAEB deliverations, if, indeed, the information that Sandler\nwill automatically seed, to all member stations does not clarify all the points\nyou have in mind.\nI honestly am not aware of whether or not this matter was discussed at Wingspread -\nI was not there, and have not seen a full report of that conference. However, I\ncan assure you that the NAEB will strive to do what seems to be best for all\nmembers. If I were going to be here, I'd be sure you are informed, but I’m not\ngoing to be, and I know that Jerry Sandler will keep all radio members informed of\nwhat actions are contemplated.\nCordially,\nmu—\nHarold E. Hill\ncc: Mr. Jerrold Sandler^\nKKH’.oNta. James Fellows"
