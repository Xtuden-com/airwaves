WNTH, as an active member of the NAEB, and specifically\nof NERN, hopes that the Board of Directors will be equally concerned\nabout the proposals in Docket 11*185 and will use whatever influence\npossible to forestall any FCC action which would eliminate the\nlow-power educational broadcaster who has a real job to do in serving\nhis local community.\nCan you suggest anything that we ourselves might do which would\nbe of help?\nyours,\nDONALD W. ICKES\nFaculty Co-Sponsor, WNTH"
