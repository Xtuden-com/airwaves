  "text": "Pennsylvania, because of its topography, offers many challenges to\nconventional coverage projectionforaulae. Withoul the use of translators\nin some of the more rugged areas, it may be a problem approaching the\nimpossible to put down a signal into every community. The alternative is\nan increased number of Class A stations. And even in this event it is\nconceivable that some translators might be required.\n>DUQ during its broadcast life of more than 16 years has realized and\ndemonstrated its responsibility to the community. It has sought to provide\nprograms, features and services not normally made available by the commercial\nradio stations of the area. Its facilities have been open to other educaÂ¬\ntional groups of the district, including the other, institutions of higher\nlearning.\nThe station is an active member of the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters and w a charter subscriber to the National Educational Radio\n(Tape) Network, thus assurin^excellent programs in a variety of interest areas\nfrom widely separated sources.\nit has been the on-going policy of WHJQ to broadcast either \"live\"\nor by delayed tape recording community avents , and comments of interest\nto various segments of the audiences.\nNo discrimination of any kind or degree is or has been practiced by the\nstation, thus deserving its boast of being a \"comunity\" radio broadcasting\nstation, in the truest sense of the word."
