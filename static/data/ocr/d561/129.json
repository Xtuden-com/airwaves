  "text": "In the matter of many broadcasting stations operating-on\nassigned frequencies at power of 10 watts or less, it has long\nbeen a considered opinion that this is less than completely productive\nutilisation of a valuable instrument, and does not fulfill the intent\ninherent in the license, it self. Essentially the same results\n(for all practical purposes) can be enjoyed with closed-circuit\noperation, requiring no assigned frequency. Thus, a channel would\nbe available for possible utilization with greater signal power\nby an organization prepared to serve a greater potential audience.\nToo frequently these extremely low-power station's are \"student\nstations\" or \"campus stations\", operated entirely by students, with only\nnominal faculty or professional supervision and direction. The proÂ¬\ngrams too often are produced for the student listener only, and in a *\nmajority of cases, although there are exceptions, provide a service\nich. could in the main be duplicated by an available > commercial\nstation.\nThe requirement of minimum stated power for any station using\na federally authorized frequency will tend to fdster greater\nresponsibility in station management which in turn will more\nrealistically project the image of the licensee into the community.\nIfe urge that each federally licensed station presently operating\nbelow the power minimum (to be determined) for stations in its\nclass, be given the opportunity to comply with the requirements\nwithin a reasonable time, without fear of penalty or loss of\nlicense 9 and that revocation of license be invoked only uoon refusal\nby the licensee* to comply with the minimum requirements for stations\nin his class within a reasonable time, or if the licensee remain\nsilent beyond the reasonable time for a reply."
