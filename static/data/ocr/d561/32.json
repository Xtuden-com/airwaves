  "text": "Statement of Intent\nfrom Illinois State University\nLicensee, WGLT\nDecember 20, 1966\nIllinois State University, licensee for WGLT in Normal, Illinois,\nwill be making application for renewal of license for a period to begin\nDecember 1, 1967. At that time we shall request to continue operating\nWGLT as a JLO watt non-commercial educational FM station for a standard\nlicense period of th&ea years. At the conclusion of that license period,\nwe shall propose to increase our power to at least 250 watts, and we\ncontemplate additional increases in following years.\n1. We will not be in a financial position to effect an increase in\npower prior to July 1, 1969, because we operate on a bienium\nbudget as a State institution. We are considering our financial\nneeds in terras of equipment, operating expenses, and staff.\n2. We feel that we need at least two or three more school-years to\ndiscover the needs and ways in which we can serve our community\nand any expanded area to be covered with increased power. We\nalso need this additional time to establish educational radio\non our campus and in the community and to determine what power\nwe need to do the best job.\n3. We know of no possible interference between WGLT and any channel\n6 television station or with any Canadian stations.\nDespite our intentions to increase the power of WGLT, however, we\nfeel that there is a place in educational broadcasting for the 10 watt\nstations.\nRespectfully submitted.\nG. Ben Paxton, Jr. S\nFaculty Sponsor, WGLT\nAssistant Professor of Speech\nIllinois State University\nNormal, Illinois 61761"
