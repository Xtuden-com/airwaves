C. 20554\nDear Mr. Waple:\nThis is in reference to \"Notice of Inquiry,' Docket No. 14185.\nAfter careful consideration and deliberation by all interested and\nconcerned individuals at the University of Vermont, we wish to make\nthe ‘following comments regarding 10-watt FM non-commercial educa\ntional broadcasting.\n1. The University of Vermont is in accord with the intent\nof the proposal of the Federal Communication Commission\nto obtain more efficient use of the FM spectrum. While\nwe realize that more efficient use of the FM spectrum\ncould be made, in some instances, by deletion of 10 watt\nFM stations, there are undoubtedly some geographical\nareas where spectrum needs would not require deletion of\nstations with this power., We would favor a station ov •\nstation analysis, rather than a deletion of all stations\nof this type. It is our feeling that when present opera¬\ntions do not interfere with proper utilization and growth\nof the FM spectrum, that these stations should be allowed\nto continue to broadcast inasmuch as such stations provide\na legitimate service at a minimum cost.\n2. While we have no definite plans at this time, it is our\njiope that at some ap_pro.pri.a.te...time in the.fatiir-elJI^Zstate^\nwide educational FM network for Vermont may become a.xficLLLty\nFM is reTatively”undeveloped in Vermont, at present, with\nonly one commercial and one educational station in the state\nThere is obviously a need for a statewide FM educational\nnetwork. We would hope that sufficient FM channels would be\nallocated to Vermont to make such a network possible.\n3. In the event that the Federal Communications Commission\nabolishes 1C-watt FM stations and requires a higher minimum"
