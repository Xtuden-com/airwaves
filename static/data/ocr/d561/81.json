This means, therfore,. that since the audience\ncannot come to us, we must come to it, and late evening or Sunday\nmorning PM programswodd provide the means.\nThe University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Bar\nAssociation are working together to develop a state-wide project in\ncontinuing legal education which could make good use of PM facilities.\nThrough live broadcasts and telephone connections, lectures by\noutstanding authorities in various fields of law could be brought\nto members of the bar in all parts of the state, followed by\ndiscussions of the points raised during the talks.\nThe World Affairs Center, another department in the General\nExtension Division, has carried on a very active world affairs\neducation program for scm©iears, organizing many meetings, dis¬\ncussions and seminars for people of all ages. PM subcarriers could\nbe used to offer in-service training programs to social studies\nteachers, and lectures and talks to clubs and organizations. The\nlarge group of organizations which works cooperatively with the\nMinnesota World Affairs Center could be drawn upon to develop\nsubject matter, plan presentations, and stimulate effective utilization.\nCourses for credit based upon high school, college, and University\nsources are the last example to be cited here of the potential uses\nof an PM multiplex facility."
