Waple\nSecretary\nFederal Communications Commission\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Mr. Waple:\nRe: Docket No. 14185\nRegarding paragraph four of your notice of inquiry concerning the\nrevision of FM broadcast rules for the educational channels,\nwe would like to make the following comments.\nThe order of St. Benedict Inc. (St. John's University) has\nsubmitted on application for channel 216 in New Brighton, Minnesota\nfor a new educational FM station exceeding the class \"A\" limitations*\nShould this application be granted, future plans call for an\nincrease in power until 50 kw horizontal and vertical is reached.\nThis station is to be operated as part of educational FM\nnetwork and will be fed by KSJR-FM in Collegeville, Minnesota.\nThe plan of operation was designed by Jansky and Bailey of\nWashington and is similar to those now operating between WGBH-FM ,\nand WFCR-FM in Massachusetts and also WUOM and WVGR-FM in\nMichigan.\nIn order for this on-the-air relay system to operate properly a\nminimum of five channels of separation between the frequencies\nof the two stations is necessary.\nIn July of this year, we filed an application for Channel 219\nin New Brighton, Minnesota however, between the time the\napplication was begun and submitted, another application was\nfiled leaving us with short, spacing.\nAt the suggestion of the FCC in a letter dated September 29, 1966\n#8720, \"It is therefore suggested that the application be\nresubmitted to specify anotherchannel, 216 or below,\" the\napplication was re-submitted, specifying that channel.\n< . â– \nl4\nl"
