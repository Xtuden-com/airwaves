BdcstP..\nInstruction of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a plan for\na statewide network complex which could be operational without land¬\nline or micro-wave linkage/\"\" Seven strategically located high power\n(50 kw) broadcasting stations,using maximum height towers, multi¬\nplexing and powerful professional receivers could cover the majority\nof population centers by picking up and passing on programs \"off the\nair\". (See Appendix A for map). These \"key\" stations would be\nsupplemented by lower power stations between the larger coverage\ncircles, thus offering programs simultaneously to approximately\n90 percent of the Commonwealth* s population. One of the sub-channels\nof the \"key\" station would feed the. network programs and broadcast\nlocally at the option of the local station. The high power stations\nwould also serve as the basic state link for any future national\neducational radio network.\nVMle it is understandable that concern for the intelligent N'\ndevelopment of eventual state-wide and/or regional radio networks\nbe directed at state bodies, it should be pointed out that there are\npresently radio installations at private institutions i*hich maintain\na strong \"community\" complexion in their offerings to general4>ud-\niemces in the community. It is to be hoped that the needs of these\noperations be weighed on equal terms in the light of their contribu¬\ntions to the enrichment of their audiences as their tax-supported\ncolleagues, and not on the basis of thei ossible affiliation."
