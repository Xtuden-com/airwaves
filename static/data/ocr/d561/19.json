  "text": "Mr, Ben Waple\n-2-\nDecember 6, 1966\nI understand that the Pinellas County Board of Public Instruction has authorized\na feasibility study to investigate.the use of radio in education. It is probable\nthat the Board will subsequently endorse the establishment of an educational EM\nRadio Station to be housed on a campus of St. Petersburg Junior College. If so,\nthen this station could well serve to realize the initial step in formulating a\nstate-wide educational radio network as outlined in- our plan.\nAs further information concerning our state-wide plan becomes available, I shall\nbe happy to provide it to the Commission.\nSincerely,\ncc: David E. Platts\n^Marjorie Newman\nJerrold Sandler\nE. G. Burrows"
