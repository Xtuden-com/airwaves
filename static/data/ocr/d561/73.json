During\nthese programs, talks and analyses of the music, together with\ninterviews with guest artists and conductors, have been supplemented\nby recordings of die music. In preparation for some Young People's\nConcerts, the conductor and others have come to the studios to\nbroadcast instructional materials for in-school use.\nKUOM's record library is called upon daily for morning, afterÂ¬\nnoon, and evening programs which run the gamut of serious music.\nThese commercial recordings have been supplemented by a wide range\nof tape recordings from the best music festivals of Europe. During\nthe last several years, these have included recordings from some\nEast European countries seldom heard on American radio stations.\nTo the greatest extent possible, live concerts by University of\nMinnesota Music Department faculty members, students, and other\nartists, also are a part of the station*s schedule.\nWith music as in other fields, KUOM cooperates with a great\nmany groups.
