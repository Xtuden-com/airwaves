Kellogg\nFoundation and was May 27 through June 1 at Allerton Park, the con¬\nference center of the University of Illinois - in a setting of\nscenic beauty, far removed from any distractions. Many remarked\nthat Allerton House was an ideal place to hold such a meeting.\nThe group lived, ate, and met together for five days. In this way\nplenty of opportunity was provided for the exchange of ideas and\nthe sharing of experiences as well as getting acquainted with others\nin educational radio stations.\nThose attending also got better acquainted with NAEB and its\nmany services to members. President Frank Schooley got us off to\na good start on Sunday evening. Executive Director Harry Skornia\nand Network Manager Bob Underwood filled in with other details\non Monday. Keith Ketcham, Bob Higgy, Carl Menzer, and John Brugger\nof the NAEB Engineering Committee were on the program. Other\nspeakers (see June Newsletter) provided authoritative technical\ninformation in their respective fields to complete a well rounded\nprogram for the week.\nGeographically NAEB member stations were represented from\nMassachusetts to California, Oregon to Florida, and Texas to\nMinnesota. A high degree of interest was maintained throughout\nand the participants, as a group, contributed much to the success\nof the program by their comments and questions directed to the pro¬\ngram speakers.\nIt is hoped that the first Radio and Audio Engineering Seminar\nis only the beginning of a series of meetings of technical per¬\nsonnel. We hope that some way can be found so that all who apply\nmay attend.\n*****\nSamuel H. Barbour has been recently appointed Chief Engineer\nof WHYY-TV of the Metropolitan Philadelphia Educational Radio and\nTelevision Corporation. He writes to say that they expect to be\non the air on Channel 35 this fall.\nc\n*****"
