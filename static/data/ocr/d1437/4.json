Bidlack, NAEB TV Engineer\nThe NAEB Engineering Committee has discussed the possibility\nof establishing a pool of test equipment which might be available for\nuse of NAEB members. It is often desirable and sometimes necessary\nfor stations to use test equipment not normally owned by every radio\nand television station. For instance, a field strength meter is not\nequipment needed for routine maintenance of transmitting equipment.\nCertainly every station sometime has wished it could make a few field\nstrength measurements or run at least four radials to get a rough idea\nof its field pattern.\nThe Committee is not proposing the NAEB purchase such equip¬\nment; some stations have test equipment they would be willing to\nloan to others nearby. So the Committee has proposed that a question¬\nnaire be sent to all NAEB radio and TV stations. These stations would\nlist the test equipment available. The data returned would be compiled\ninto an inventory of test equipment. By referring to such an inventory,\nthe location of the test equipment you need could be determined and a\ntelephone call could make the necessary arrangements for its loan.\nPerhaps you would be hesitant to loan a $2,500 field strength\nmeter; yet it has been done, the measurements made and the meter\nreturned in first class shape. The Committee feels the plan will work,\nespecially if the chief engineers concerned know each other."
