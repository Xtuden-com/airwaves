It is now under the\nable direction of Bob Allbaugh.\nVern Carlson, upon graduation, entrusted\nthe program to Bill Merrill. Bill did right\nwell with the popular platters until Uncle\nSam beckoned to him. Now he’s with the\narmy at San Antonio, Texas, devoting his\ntalents to becoming a cog in the American\narmy.\nBob Allbaugh, a popular music fan, took\na whirl at the job and has steadily im¬\nproved. Bob, by the way, lives on request\nmail, so don’t be bashful. A card or a\nletter will bring you the selection you\nwant if it’s in the WOI library.\nIf you want to hear popular music, stay\ntuned to 640 on your dial from 4:45 to 5:30\non Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs¬\nday and Friday. On Saturday, the pro¬\ngram pops out of your speaker under the\ntitle of “Saturday Serenade” from 1:30 to\n2:30 in the afternoon.\nRADIO BOOK CLUB\nHelen Hurlbutt voices reviews for WOI’s\n“lending library of the air.” Each Mon¬\nday and Friday at 8:15 a. m., listeners\nhear description of new titles added to the\nlending list of this radio library. This\nservice to radio listeners, operated at cost\nby WOI and the Iowa State College Li¬\nbrary, permits members to borrow books\nwhich may not be available in their home\ncommunities. Titles range from fiction\nthrough history, biography and science.\nCost of a Book Club Membership\nA $3 fee entitles you to borrow 20\nbooks, postpaid.\nA $2 fee entitles you to borrow 12\nbooks, postpaid.\nBook lists are furnished with member¬\nship.\nRenewal memberships will be issued\nat a reduction of 50 cents for 20 coupons\nor 25 cents for 12 coupons.\nWrite for the book club catalog.\nSCHEDULE CHANGES\nDuring April, May and June, the Federal\nCommunications Commission fixes a later\nsign-off time for WOI.
