Under the title “Classroom\nTV Comes To Samoa,” Tom Kaser, educa¬\ntion editor of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin,\ntells of developments on the islands since\nthe first NAEB study team went there in\n1961.\nThe article was printed in the Congres¬\nsional' Record for June 28, 1965, at the re¬\nquest of Senator Frank Church, from Ida¬\nho—native state of Rex Lee, Governor of\nAmerican Samoa.\nAt its June meeting, the NAEB Board of\nDirectors commended Vernon Bronson, head\nof the project for NAEB, “for the success-\n' ful completion of the first phase of the\nproject to install television as the core of\nthe instructional system in the elementary\nschools in American Samoa.”\nNER Plans\nNationwide Hookup\nPlans are afoot for NER member sta¬\ntions to broadcast live coverage of the Ger¬\nman Parliamentary Elections September 19\nvia a special transatlantic hookup. This will\nbe the first time educational radio stations\naround the nation have had such a nation¬\nwide connection.\nCooperating with NER in the project are\nRadio Deutsche Welle, Cologne, Germany,\nRadio New York World Wide in New York\nCity, and Lufthansa. The coverage, approx¬\nimately three hours, will feature special re¬\nports, commentaries, and interviews about\nthe election, along with spot reports from\ncontacts in Bonn. Deutsche Welle will also\nbe receiving election results and computer\npredictions via direct line to the German\nTV studios located in the Bundestag.\nUSIA Director Appointed\nLeonard H. Marks has been appointed by\nPresident Johnson to replace Carl T. Row¬\nan as Director of the USIA. Mr. Marks re¬\ncently became a public director of the\nNAEB and attended the full board meet¬\nings of the NAEB in Columbus.\nNAEB-ETS Receives\nKellogg Grant\nThe ETS Program Service, to facilitate\nthe exchange among ETV stations through¬\nout the country of high-quality programs\nproduced by individual stations, will be lo¬\ncated at Indiana University. A $344,840\ngrant to help the service, just received\nfrom the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, as¬\nsures its operation by the fall of 1965.\nIn addition an offer of a generous con¬\ntribution of programs and tapes has been\nreceived from NET. Last year a grant of\n$80,000 was made available for the project\nby the National Home Library Foundation\nof Washington, D.C.\nETV Financing Inadequate,\nSays NAEB-ETS Report\n“The financial structure of educational\ntelevision stations is critical at this time.\nThe urgency is felt by both the licensees\nand the station managers, and interest is\nextremely high in moving toward perman¬\nent solutions.”\nThis is one of the conclusions in a new\n182-page report issued by NAEB-ETS after\nseven months of study. The comprehensive\nreport contains analyses of financial state¬\nments of the ninety-five ETV stations on\nthe air at the time of the study—as well as\nstatements, addresses, and recommendations\nof the project’s kick-off conference in\nWashington last December. More than two\nhundred attended the conference, which in¬\ncluded representatives of the governing\nboards of ETV stations as well as station\nmanagers.\nCopies of the report are $2 each, C.O.D.\nor if payment accompanies order. Send or¬\nders to ETS at the NAEB Washington of¬\nfice.\nFrederick Breitenfeld conducted the proj¬\nect for ETS, under a USOE grant, to try\nto find ways to improve and stabilize sup¬\nport of ETV stations. The group that met\nin Washington recommended that support\nbe found for additional national program\nresources and a means for national program\nexchange among ETV stations.\nPlans will be announced shortly for es¬\ntablishment of the ETS Program Service,\nto be supported initially by about $500,003\nin grants from foundations and other pri¬\nvate sources. This is a direct result of the\nconference recommendation.\nAmong other recommendations were\nthese: appointment of a national commis¬\nsion or committee to study ETV and sug¬\ngest courses of action for its future devel¬\nopment ; and giving immediate encourage¬\nment to plans for further development of\nregional networks, since regional and na¬\ntional interconnection will be vital to the\nfuture of the medium.\nNAEB Files Comments\nwith FCC on CATV\nThe NAEB supported the FCC conclusion\nthat “while CATV systems are capable of\nmaking a valuable contribution toward the\nachievement of expanded television recep¬\ntion service, it is of the utmost importance\nto the over-all public interest that extension\nof the Table of Assignments by auxiliary\ndistribution means are accomplished on a\nfair and orderly basis, and that CATV\nsystems and television broadcast facilities\nhave complementary rather than conflicting\nroles. The distribution of multiple reception\nservices through CATV cannot be permitted\nto curtail the viability of existing local\nservice or to inhibit the growth of potential\nservice by new broadcast facilities.” The\nNAEB stated that, while the FCC framed\nits conclusion primarily concerning com¬\nmercial TV stations, it applies equally to\nthe educational TV service.\nThe NAEB comments pointed out the\ndanger that individuals and organizations\nmight be less likely to lend full support to\na local ETV station if they could obtain\nadequate ETV service from CATV.\nAfter detailed comments on many other\nfactors involved in the CATV problem, the\nNAEB statement concluded that ETV sta¬\ntions on the whole favor CATV develop¬\nment—but that some form of regulation\nmay be necessary to prevent indiscriminate\nand unauthorized use of ETV materials to\nthe detriment of local ETV stations. The\nstatement recommended that FCC rules be\nflexible “to permit local accommodation to\nCATV in the manner best suited for the\nparticular situation.”\nThe policy statement resulted from exten¬\nsive study and several meetings of the ETS\nCATV committee.\n1"
