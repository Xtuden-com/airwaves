  "text": "To: Mr. Sandler\nJune 29, 1967\nAs I indicated in an earlier memorandum and conversation, I\nhave reviewed with our attorneys in considerable detail the\nFairleigh Dickinson University/New York University applications\nfor FM frequencies. Although they are coincidentally counsel\nfor Fairleigh Dickinson University, their recommendation is\nthat the Association not file on this matter for the following\nreasons:\n1. Any position we might take on the issues would inevi¬\ntably place us in the position of displeasing one or the other\nof the applicants. We have carefully tried to avoid this\ndilemma in the past through a cautious policy of taking sides\nin comparative and competitive hearings between educational\nand commercial applicants and the policy is even more appli¬\ncable to two educational applicants.\n2. We have no standing in this case. The matter is\nbetween two applications for a single FM frequency in the\nNew York City area, and for us to have any legal standing\nwhatsoever would require our petition to the Hearing Examiner\nseeking to intervene as a party in this case. This is not\nespecially difficult and there is reason to believe that the\nHearing Examiner would approve such a petition. I mention\nthis, however, to point out that there is far more cost and\ncommitment involved in pursuing this legal procedure than\nthere is in the usual procedure which we follow in Rule\nMaking Petitions where we, as would any other interested\nparty, would have a legal right to file comments. We do not\nhave such legal right in the present case unless the Commission\ngives it to us upon petition. The test of whether our petition\nwould be accepted is whether our intervention could be seen\nas helping the Commission prepare an adequate record in the\ncase."
