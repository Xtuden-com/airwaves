Bob Hilliard called the other\nday to say that the FCC has run across a unique situation\nIn the State of Alabama, which apparently has a law saying\nthat the only group or agency which can apply for an eduÂ¬\ncational broadcasting station license in the State of Alabama\nis the State ETV Commission. The FCC is checking this out\nto be sure of the precise language and implications; it may\nbe subsequently raised as a matter of conflict between state\nand federal law.\n- WOH\n00: Bob Mott\nWSt/he"
