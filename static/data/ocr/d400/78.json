  "text": "-3-\nwe have a set of issues which, in our opinion, will be\nsubstantially improved criteria than the Commission is now\nemploying for reaching decisions on matters affecting compara¬\ntive hearings for educational applicants. If, in our judg¬\nment substantial policy decisions are going to be set forth\nin this case, and if we believe there will be a large number\nof subsequent competitive applications where this policy\nwill be applied this would be an additional argument to\nsupport intervention.\nI believe the nature of this situation does not require any\nlegal action by the NAEB within the comparative hearing and\nmy reasons are summarized as follows:\n1. We have no additional criteria which we believe the\nCommission should employ in contests between educational\napplicants and between possible location of educational fre¬\nquencies .\n2. The likelihood of a large number of such contests\nin the future seems very slim. As with this, so in the\nfuture, the matter is only likely to come up when a C.P.\nholder or licensee vacates a channel.\n3. Participation in hearings is costly and time\nconsuming.\nI would appreciate your views on these comments as soon as\npossible. The decision must be made by July 13, which is\n30 days from the time of the publication of the Commission\nMemorandum Opinion and Order in the Federal Register.\ns\nJF:smg\ncc: Mr. Burke"
