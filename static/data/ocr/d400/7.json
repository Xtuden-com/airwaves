But the FCC declared this charge was unsup¬\nported by facts.\nThe telcos also argued that UPM rates appeared to be noncompensatory.\nThe Commission agreed that the microwave companies' rates were \"quite low\"\nin comparison with telco rates for the same service, but Commission cal¬\nculations indicated \"there...is no substantial question as to whether the\nrates are compensatory.\"\nThe Commission said the deciding factor in the case was the public\ninterest. It noted that while the telephone company might suffer \"some\nrather minor loss of revenue or potential revenue,\" parties desiring the\nmicrowave service might not be able to afford the higher telco rates\n(which the Commission calculated to be nearly four times as high as UPM's\nmonthly charges)."
