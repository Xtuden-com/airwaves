  "text": "October 31, 1968\nMEMORANDUM\nTo: William G. Harley\nFrom: H. H. Riddleberger\nWith respect to the FCC's concern about an Alabama law\nwhich reportedly prohibited any other group than the State ETV\nCommission from applying for an educational broadcasting station\nlicense; The matter is now peacefully closed. The law actually\nonly places in the hands of the Commission full responsibility\nfor the development of non-commercial television throughout the\nstate, and says nothing about prohibiting others from filing.\nActually, the Commission intends to interpret the word \"television”\nas \"broadcasting” which was apparently the legislatures intent.\nHe is going this week before an Educational Study Commission of\nthe state legislature to discuss plans for the next ten years for\neducational communications in Alabama.\nThere seems, therefore, to be no conflict between state and\nfederal law; the Commission has in fact no more authority than a\ndozen other commissions in other states.\ncc: Robert Mott J\nHHR/cj"
