What are the requirements for the\ncoming year - quality and kind of service,\nnumber of hours per week, number of days,\nlocation of stations to be interconnected?\nHow much is spent on interconnection?\nÂ© What experience do we have in attempting to\nnegotiate free or reduced rates since the Act\nwas adopted? Before?\no Should rates be \"free\" or \"reduced\"? Reduced\nby how much? Can we distinguish situations in\nwhich, free service is appropriate .^rom, those in\nwhich reduced service is desirable - in terms of\nthe kind of program, e.g., instructional,\nchildren's programs , or the kind of service,\ne.g., prime time vs. off-peak service.\no Do \"instructional\" and \"educational\" television\nand radio raise the same problems, or should\nthey be treated differently? What about television\nvs. radio?\n5."
