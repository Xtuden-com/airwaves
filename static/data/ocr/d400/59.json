C.\nDear Bob;\nThe enclosed article is the most precise information\nwe have regarding state radio networks. I do not\nbelieve it will meet the needs for programming the\ncomputer in the effort to develop the flexible FM\nfrequency table you told me about.\nI simply have not had time to develop any information\non state networks since I began my duties with NER.\nNone exists in the office.\nIn view of your indication that there is an immediate\nneed for any material regarding state network planning,\nI doubt that it would be practical to make a field\ninquiry. I suspect returns would be s&&w in coming\nback and would be too spotty to be of value.\nPerhaps it is better to not program for the computer\nat all in this regard rather than to come up with poor\ndata. Doesn*t GIGO apply here?\nSincerely,\nRAM: lkl\nEnclosure\nRobert A. Mott"
