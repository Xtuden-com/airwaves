Hill\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nSuite 1119\n13^6 Connecticut Avenue\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Mr. Hill:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Robert F. Schenkkan is ill and will have to be\nout of the office for a few days.\nUpon receipt of your wire of March 29 concerning the request by\nChairman Oren Harris for information on state plans for activating\neducational television, we conferred with Governor Price Daniel.\nHe had not yet received any such request, but I imagine it will be\nforthcoming within a few days.\nGovernor Daniel is a truthful man and will not be inclined to\ngo beyond the facts. However, he will tell Congressman Harris that\nthe Texas Education Agency (our state department of education) is\npromoting and coordinating the development of educational television\nin the state, that the Legislature now in session is expected to pass\na resolution authorizing the preparation of a state plan for educa¬\ntional television, that much coordinated planning has already been\nachieved through voluntary cooperation of the agencies involved, and\nthat there is high interest in the state in moving forward vigorously\nwith the development of educational television.\nActually, we have no official state plan and the governor cannot\nsay this. However, he can state quite truthfully that his administra¬\ntion and the State Board of Education are back of the proposed\nlegislative action to establish such a plan, and that the chances of\ncc: Mr. R. F. Schenkkan"
