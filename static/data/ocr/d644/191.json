  "text": "Shifting of channels from the towns to which they are allocated\nis possible., Such shifting can only be accomplished upon the basis of a\ndetailed engineering study. Following is a list of channels which should\nbe reserved whenever the proper State officials feel that development of\na statewide ETV network is likely in Kentucky. Only the shift of channel 24\nfrom Maysville to Morehead requires an FCC order. Channel 54 can be\nused in Covington although it is assigned to Cincinnati.\nLocation Channel Number\nAshland 59\nBowling Green 17\nCovington 54\nHazard 19\nMadisonville 26\nMaysville (shift to Morehead) 24\nMurray 33\nPikeville 14\nSomerset 29\nExcept for channels 59 in Ashland and 54 in Covington, the\nchannels suggested for reservation have low numbers. A rule of thumb is\nthat the lower the number, the better the channel.\nThe FCC must be requested, through a ’’Petition for Rule Making,”\nto make the ETV reservations. The request should include an appeal for\nshifting of channel 24. A report by a licensed engineer must be included in¬\ndicating that the shift is technically feasible and complies with FCG regula¬\ntions concerning channel spacing. The petition should be made by some\nofficial (such as the Governor or the Superintendent of Public Instruction)\nor government agency (such as the Legislative Research Commission) or\ncombination of the two, and should point out that the General Assembly can\nnot proceed to act on ETV unless channels are available.\n- 7 -"
