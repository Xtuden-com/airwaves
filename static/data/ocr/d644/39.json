  "text": "-6-\nIlllnols - The state legislature in 1955 authorized school boards to par¬\nticipate in ETV. In 1955 the State University at Urbana went on the air with its\nown ETV station, after winning a long court fight to use general funds. Southern\nIllinois University now has a construction permit for a station at Carbondale.\nChicago has been operating a cooperative community ETV station since 1955, and\nnow the program schedule demands the use of additional channels.\nIowa - The State University at Ames pioneered in the use of television\nfor education, and in 1959 the Des Moines school system went on the air with\nits own station. The University, at Iowa City, has extensive plans, but is\nhandicapped by the lack of funds.\nIndiana - This state has constructed no ETV facilities yet, but in 1959\nthe legislature authorized public schools to use funds for the production of ^TV\nprogramming. Production centers have been established at Purdue and Indiana\nUniversities, and several public school systems are using ETV programs broad¬\ncast from commercial stations or coming across state lines from ETV stations\nin Louisville and Chicago.\nKansas - In 1959 the legislature appropriated $25,000 for the study of\na state ETV network plan. The study was made over a two-year period and a\nstate plan has been recommended to the current legislature. It calls for the con¬\nstruction of six transmitters and three major production centers. The legislature\nis now trying to find funds to make a start on this urgently needed program. In\nthe meantime the cities of Wichita, Topeka, and Kansas City have been experi¬\nmenting with ETV in the classroom, with uniformly encouraging results."
