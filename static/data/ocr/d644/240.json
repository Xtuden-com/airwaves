Bowden\nDate: August 23, 1961 {\nSubject: FEDERAL EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION BILL, H.R.132\nOn August 17, H.R.132 (the Roberts Bill), providing for Federal aid to constructÂ¬\nion of educational television station, was favorably reported out of the House\nInterstate and Foreign Commerce Committee by a large affirmative 21-3 vote.\nThe principal provisions of the bill, as they now stand, are as follows:\n1. That $10,000 matching funds per state be appropriated for state\nETV surveys.\n2. That $25,000,000 matching funds be appropriated for the construction\nof ETV stations in the nation over a four-year period of time.\n3. That provisions be made for state plans to be developed cooperatively\nby two or more states if so desired.\nk. That grants be made on a project-by-project basis rather than on a\nstate-by-state basis, (intrastate and interstate cooperation between\neducational agencies likely will be viewed with favor.)\n5. That credit will be given for previous capital expenditures for ETV.\n(This feature was restored by the Committee last week.)\n6. That no federal grants be contemplated for closed circuit transmission\nwithin a single school or a single site.\nThe bill must now be passed by the House Rules Committee before it can be\nplaced on the House calendar. Your views regarding this bill are important\nat this particular point in time.\nThe Southern members of the House Rules Committee, House of Representatives, United\nStates Congress, are listed below in the event you wish to make your views known\nto any of them.\nThe Honorable Howard W. Smith, Broad Run, Virginia (Chairman)\nThe Honorable William M. Colmer, Pascagoula, Mississippi\nThe Honorable James W. Trimble, Berryville, Arkansas\nThe Honorable Homer Thornberry, Austin, Texas\nThe Honorable Carl Elliott, Jasper, Alabama\nWilliam L. Bowden\nAssociate Director\nWLB:gh"
