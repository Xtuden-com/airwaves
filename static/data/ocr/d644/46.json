The educational and community interests\nw orking for ETV would lose much of their legislative support to other programs\nThis would be especially difficult to overcome in the states which have\nbiennial legislatures. The time, energy and local money lost to the developÂ¬\nment of ETV would be incalculable if there were to be any great delay in\nFederal assistance.\nThere are 28 states where substantial investments have already been\nmade in ETV. These include 7 western states, 8 mid-western states, 4\neastern states, and 9 southern states. But in all of these states further\ndevelopment is new largely dependent on Federal assistance and in many\ninstances a prolonged delay would seriously retard program development and\ncooperative schooljutllization.\nThere are 21 localities which have applied for ETV station Construction\nPermits or which have asked for specific channels to be reserved preliminary\nto applying, and in most instances the action was based upon the hopes of\nthe proposed legislature. Postponement at this point would seriously\njeopardize these developments. Tnere are 26 states which have either\nstate or local planning for new ETV development which is contingent upon\nFederal assistance. In many of these, planning has advanced to a critical\nstage, and prolonged delay would be disastrous, and in any event would\nretard beginning development through another biennium. A listing of some\nof those states will better illustrate the situation:"
