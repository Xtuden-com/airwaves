Postponetasnt new would\nprobably destroy the possibility for years.\nThe sum of this recital is that all over the eouutxy work and\nplans for ETV development have been sparked by the hope and promise of\nFederal legislation. A large proportion of the plans have been guided by\nthis promise. The time is crucial, as the description of the situation in\nthe several states and many localities indicates. Another postponement,\nor serious delay, at this time would seriously handicap this development\nfor years - in some cases, many years. In addition to this, there! is\nalways the threat of losing the reserved channels, or of being too late to\ndrop-in a necessary channel.\nShe need stands aloe and separate from other needs. This legisla¬\ntion will not affect any other legislation. The need is now, and a dollar\nnow would be worth several in the future. There is a time for all progressive\ndevelopments to move. STV has reached that critical moment - it moves now, or\nendangers its total progress."
