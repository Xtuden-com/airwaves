C*\nBear Morgan,\nI have been following with interest the work of the subcommittee on\nCommunications and Power of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce\nCommittee as you have been conducting hearings in connection with the\nconsideration of legislation to provide federal aid to educational\ntelevision. I was especially pleased that you called upon Ed Lambert of\nthe University of Missouri to testify as a witness before you.\nMay I add my support to this legislation which you are considering.\nWe know that television is a powerful medium of communication. We know\nthat this medium can be used effectively in education. We know, too, that\neducators will not be able to take full advantage of the medium for educaÂ¬\ntional purposes unless federal aid is forthcoming.\nTelevision, as an aid to education, can only be justified if it improves\neducation or makes education more readily available to greater numbers of\nour citizens at less cost than other methods. It is difficult for any one\ninstitution to justify the initial outlay for television equipment. However,\na federal grant would enable a more unified effort on the part of educators\nin the use of the medium. It is important that educators spend their efforts\nin utilization of the mediua rather than in attempting to obtain equipment.\nI hope that your committee will continue to work closely with the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters, an organisation which represents,\nI think, the best cross section of thinking today by educators, who are\naware of the problems associated with educational television broadcasting.\nBest wishes to you.\nSincerely,\nHeal Balanoff, Chairman\nTelevision, Radio & Film Department\nand Director, Audio Visual Services\nKBijm\nbcc: Harold E. Hill"
