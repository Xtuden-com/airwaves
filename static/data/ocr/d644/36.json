The NAEB has been\nconducting a continuous study of these efforts and of the multiplying needs which\nimpel such efforts.\nThe NAEB study indicates that the passage of legislation lending assistÂ¬\nance to educational television construction would immediately expedite this\nenormous amount of bogged-down development and create an additional surge\ntoward complete and effective use of all the reserved channels.\nThe schools, colleges and communities in every state are ready and eager\nto make effective use of these resources for formal and informal education as\nsoon as they can be financed. In the several states a variety of actions and\nforces have worked together to weigh the value of this medium to education\ngenerally and to pave the way for its use. Legislative action, administrative\norder, private philanthropy, and community cooperation have all contributed to\nthe preparation that now awaits fulfilment through Congressional action.\nForty-five states have now actively participated in and supported the\ndevelop*rent of educational television, and twenty-five of them have formed\nState ETV Commissions by direction of their respective legislatures. In all of\nthese states, in some degree or other, the public schools, the institutions of\nhigher learning, and the communities have all been involved."
