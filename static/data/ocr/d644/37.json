It now has three ETV stations on\nthe air and has spent approximately $3, 000, 000 to date on this development. It\nhas proven need of at least three more stations at the present time to provide for\nits basic service.\nArizona - This state has two ETV stations now on the air. The first\nstation went on the air in 1959 at the University of Arizona, Tucson; and the\nsecond station went on the air in February of this year under the auspices of\nArizona State College at Tempe. The transmitter is actually located in Phoenix\nand serves the entire surrounding community.\nArkansas - This state has been investigating possibilities of providing\nETV to its people since 1958; the activities of the state committee established\nby the legislature in 195/ have been recently revived.\nCalifornia - In 1952 the Governor appointed an advisory committee on\nETV, and twice since then the legislature has taken action to encourage its\ndevelopment. This state now has ETV broadcasting stations at San Francisco\nand Sacramento, and two more planned at San Bernardino and San Diego. It also\nhas several well-developed closed-circuit operations. But the demonstrated need\nfor more broadcast stations grows every day. Its largest metropolitan areas are\nnot being served.\nColorado - In 1956 the public school system of Denver put an ETV station\non the air as a part of its general and adult education program. In 1960 the\nlegislature passed an act to allow various school districts to operate television\ntranslator facilities. At least three more stations are needed now."
