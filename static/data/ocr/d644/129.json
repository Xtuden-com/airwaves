  "text": "April 5\n1961\nThe Honorable Anther Nelsen\nU.S. Representative from Minnesota\nHouse Office Building\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Representative Nelsen:\nAs I am sure you know KTCA-TV, under terms of a\ngrant to its Board of Trustees from the Hill\nFoundation, has pioneered in the development of\na Six-State Educational Television Network. Such\na network will be of inestimable benefit to the\nchildren of Minnesota and the entire area but will\nprobably be impossible without the provision of\nFederal aid to educational television.\nI enclose a copy of a House Concurrent Resolution\nadopted March 14th by the Minnesota Legislature\nwhich encourages the establishment of the Six-\nState Network. Similar resolutions have been\npassed in North Dakota and South Dakota. Similar\nlegislation is now under consideration by the\nlegislatures of Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin.\nUnder these circumstances may I respectfully urge\nyou to support such legislation wfcich, I understand,\nis now before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce\nCommittee of the House of Representatives.\nVery truly yours,\nbe: Harold Hill\nChris Donaldson"
