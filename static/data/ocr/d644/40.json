  "text": "-7-\nKentuckv - The only station in the state is in Louisville where the public\nschool system, with help from a foundation grant and commercial stations,\noperates a modest facility. This year the legislature directed its Research Com*?\nmittee to make a survey of the potential of ETV for Kentucky and the State\nAdvisory Committee, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, is currently develop¬\ning a plan for a state ETV network.\nLouisiana - This state has encouraged the development of ETV since\n1952. In 1954 it created the Louisiana ETV Commission, and appropriated $150,000\nfor facilities. The state has two ETV stations now operating, but definitely\nneeds help for further development.\nMaine - Originally established a state committee on ETV in 1955\nand re-activated it by legislative act in 1957, Much study and planning have\nbeen accomplished, and now two ETV stations are planned for the near future\nand two additional reservations have been requested for later use. The\nonly thing lacking here is sufficient capital funds.\nMassachusetts - The legislature established a commission on ETV in\n1952 and enlarged it in 1953 and provided funds for its work. Legislation\nwas enacted to permit public schools to participate financially in ETV pro¬\ngramming. In 1955 a cooperatively financed ETV station went on the air in\nBoston.\nMichigan - This state is now conducting a study to devise a plan for\na state-wide ETV service. The study is expected to be completed this year.\nAt present ETV stations are on the air in Detroit and East Lansing, and\nstations are being planned in Mount Pleasant and Kalamazoo."
