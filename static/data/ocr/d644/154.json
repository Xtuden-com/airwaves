They have learned that it is simply\nanother medium for getting ideas across—and a very powerful one.\nAs I see it, the legislation you are considering today has for its\nprimary purpose making educational television available to every section\nof the United States where it is needed and can be useful.\nIt seems to me that the time is ripe for such action. The adminis¬\ntration is ready for it. The States are ready for it. The foundation has\nbeen laid. Experience has proven its worth. And the educators now accept\nit."
