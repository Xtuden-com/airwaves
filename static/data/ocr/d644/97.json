  "text": "- k -\nThe television courses are reaching a group of students\nmost of whom would otherwise not take junior college work. It\nis serving a group of handicapped and otherwise restricted\nstudents. It is reaching a group of non-credit students, which\naverages several times the size of the group studying for credit.\nIt is also reaching a group of oasual viewers who are registered\nneither for credit nor without credit—an \"eavesdropping\"\naudience about which we know very little but which is estimated\nto range from five to twenty-five thousand persons per program.\nIn other words, it seems to us that offering junior college\ncourses on television is a service to the City of Chicago far\nwider than the service to credit students.\nEvidence of the high motivation of the TV students and the\nwelcome given the TV courses is the fact that about 6£ per cent\nof the television students finish their courses and take the\nfinal examinations. This completion rate is quite remarkable when\ncompared with other forms of adult education for credit*\nFederal grants to the States to aid them in establishing educational\ntelevision broadcasting stations and networks can encourage low-cost\nextension of educational opportunities for adults as has been provided by\nChicago’s TV College since 19E>6. It is doubtful that any other investment in\nbroadcasting and education can pay such high dividends for individual\ncitizens and for the State."
