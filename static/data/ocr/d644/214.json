McClellan, Chairman\nSenate Government Operations Committee\n3302 New Senate Office Building\nWashington 25, D, C.\nDear Mr. McClellan:\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters enthusiastically\nendorses S.2119, a bill to amend the Federal Property and Administrative\nServices Act of 1949 so as to permit donations of surplus property to\nschools for the mentally retarded, schools for the physically handi¬\ncapped, educational television stations and public libraries.\nAs the trade association, representing this Nation's 57 television\nstations, we believe that adoption of S.2119 would make available to\neducational television stations across the nation certain surplus prop¬\nerties at a cost commensurate with their ability to pay. One of the\nbig deterents to a natural growth and expansion of educational tele¬\nvision in this country has been the high cost of equipment. This\nbill would permit educational television stations to purchase certain\nitems of needed equipment from surplus government property at a\nmore modest cost, thus encouraging the growth and expansion of\neducational television and thereby helping develop a valuable re¬\nsource in the service of education and the national welfare.\nYour considered support of this legislation is urgently requested.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH;kfm"
