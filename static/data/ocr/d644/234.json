Ho R* 132 provides matching funds up to one\nmillion dollars, per state on a fifty-fifty basis and grants up\nto ten thousand dollars to each state also on a matching basis\nfor the purpose of making a survey in the development of a pro-\ngram, for ETV in each state*\nThe Montana ETV Committee is oh record in favor of Senate\nBill 205 and its companion bill H* R* 965* ^he House'Interstate\nand Foreign Commerce Committee now having passed H* R„ 132, it\nbehooves each of us to support passage of H* R* 132 and then exert\nour influence to see that revisions are made in conference com¬\nmittee between the Senate and the House*\nH* R* 132 must now be passed by the House Rules Committee\nbefore it can be placed on the House calendar. The members\nare listed on the reverse side* r hope you will write to any\nmembers of that committee or its chairman, Howard W* Smith, ex¬\npressing your view that this bill should be passed by the Rules\nCommittee for consideration by the entire House* It would be wise\nto send a carbon copy of your letter to our representatives,\nArnold Olsen and James Battin*"
