The late afternoon is usually devoted to programs for women\nand children, whereas the evenings are devoted to adult education as well\nas cultural and educational types of programming.\nOf the stations now on the air, about 40 percent are financed and\ncontrolled by universities, about 20 percent are part of a public school\nsystem, and the remaining 40 percent are sponsored by independent community\nagencies."
