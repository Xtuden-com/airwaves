This, as well as a regular evaluation\nof results, will also be a function of the Committee.\nThe University Committee on Radio will not give academic courses or instruc¬\ntion in radio. It is anticipated, however, that courses will be developed as the\ndifferent needs of the separate schools and departments make themselves felt.\nHere the Committee, the Station, and the Staff can be of service; for, purely in\nan advisory or teaching capacity, they can make their experiences and technical\nskills available to such as may require them. In the same way, the studios and\ntechnical equipment of the Station -- wherever feasible -- will be used for in¬\nstruction.\nThe University Committee and the Station are designed to serve the University\nin its general and special concerns. By the same token, they represent the whole\nUniversity and cannot speak only for a special group or interest. This whole ac¬\ntivity i3 neither the creation nor the exclusive possession of any single school\nor department -- it is University Radio.\nThe Committee will examine and approve the annual budget of the Director of\nRadio in the University. It will also examine and approve his annual report to\nthe University Trustees."
