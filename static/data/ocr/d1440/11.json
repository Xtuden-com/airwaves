That a policy be established limiting membership to those\nstations broadoaating on the university (adult) level and\nadmitting only those school broadcasters whose problems\nare comparable*\n3* That a standing committee on membership be appointed to\npass on all applications.\nRespectfully submitted\nWaldo Abbot\nGeorge Jennings\nAlan Miller, Ex-officlo\nRobert J. Coleman, Chairman\nWhile not within the province of this committee, we would like\nsuggest that committees be appointed to explore the followings\n1. Under the present constitution, active membership is NAEB\nis limited to those colleges and universities who operate\ntheir own broadcasting stations while associate membership\nonly is granted those institutions using facilities not\ntheir own. Some of the latter are actually presenting a\nmore comprehensive program than some of the former and are\nencountering many of the same problems of production and\nas those owning stations. It therefore Beeras logical that\nÂ«. Colleges and universities operating their own stations\nbe accepted as ACTIVE members only.\nb, That institutions using facilities not their own be\ngranted the option of Active or Associate membership\nas they may choose.\nc. That membership, both active and associate, be limited\nto those who are actively engaged in management of\noperation of a radio station. (Is there a danger that\nteachers of journalism, music, dpeech or dramatics may\nbecome members and thereby hamper the free discussion\nof problems of management eto?)\n2. A committee might explore the possibility of printing a\nbooklet or folder outlining the alms and purposes of NAEB,\nits policies, membership requirements and other pertinent\ninformation* This could be used to inform those colleges\nnow entering the broadcasting field of our organization. It\ncould serve to stimulate these colleges to make application\nfor membership in NAEB."
