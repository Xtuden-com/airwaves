  "text": "11\nmen outnumbered womens especially in the labor force, and because\nthe employed persons were much more often shown as law-breakers\nthan those not in the labor force, in the aggregate men on TV were\nmore often pictured as law-breakers than were women.\nOf the Professionals, four-fifths were law-abiding, but of the\nManagers, Officials and Proprietors, only two-thirds were. Within\nthe latter group, 92 percent of the public officers (including\npoliticians) were law-abiding, as compared with 73 percent of the\nlegitimate business men, and 7 percent of the managers and proprie¬\ntors of illegal enterprises. Indigenous TV drama thus shows public\nofficials as more respectful of law than private business officials.\nAmerican white characters were slightly more often shown as\nlaw-abiding than were other TV characters. The small numbers of\nNegroes, American Indians, Latin Americans, Irish, Danish, Norwegian,\nScottish and Polynesians were all law-abiding. The largest propor*\ntions of law-breakers were found among other nationalities, of whom\nthe Italians had the lowest proportion of law-abiding characters\nCUU percent).\nTV drama heroes averaged 32 years of age, villains h3» and\nsupporting characters 37. The average age of men was greater than\nthat of women when they were heroes (3U and 29), and when they\nwere supporting characters (39 and 33)* However, where villains were\nconcerned the average women was older than the man (b7 as against 1*2).\nIt seems that whereas heroes of both sexes were in the prime years\nof physical and sexual power, villains were representative of the\nmenace of an older generation with more social power but physically\nand sexually on the wane.\nWhite Americans provided more, proportionately, of the heroes"
