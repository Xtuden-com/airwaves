  "text": "I have also submitted the proposal to our own Social Research\nBureau at Michigan State. The first conversation on this\nwith the Head of the Department brought the thought that they\nwould not be interested and suggestion of a price far beyond\nwhat we have to spend. I later talked with one of the men\nwho would do the work and he did not think in the same terms\nas the Head. I believe that our agency could be counted out\non this one. If there is further information I will get it\nto you.\nI note that you suggested the Institute for Communications\nResearch at Illinois as a possibility. I did not send the\nproposal to Schram since I had already sent it to \"alias.\nIf there is any difference there perhaps you can see Schram\nabout it.\nI am expecting more returns ina day or two and will send\nthe correapondence along. I hope that lam correct in doing\nit this way but I feel that, since the final decisions must\ncome from there, I am only delaying things by keeping all the\ncorrespondence here and trying to get a committee decision\nby mail. The time factor will not allow this method.\nsincerely,\nR.J.Coleman, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\ncc Crayaon Ausmus"
