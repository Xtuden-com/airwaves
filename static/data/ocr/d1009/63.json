  "text": "May 18, 1954\nDr* Harry J* Skornia\nExecutive Director, NAEB\n119 Gregory Hall\nThe University\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nHere*s our revised chapter on \"Public Issues*\" If more time\nwere available we could, of course, expand it further in terms of\nwhat the critics say and by means of armchair speculation.\nObviously, the data are as they are and they admit of no further\nuseful analysis. Our discussion does make clear, 1 believe, the\ndifficulties that bedevil the problems of evaluation. The revision\nof this chapter will require a few slight changes in the Table of\nContents* I assume you can make these.\nIf you or Frank Schooley will review our correspondence you\nwill find that I was able to get no clarification from Bob Coleman\non what hypotheses if any were to be tested re public issues on\nTV. Xou will also recall that Bob Mainer and I asked you and\nFrank what the Executive Committee might have discussed concerning\nthe problem that might guide us. There had apparently been no\nsuch discussion. Finally, It was not made clear to us that public\nissues were to be a major focus of the study. On the contrary,\ncomparability with previous studies was stressed as the major\nconsideration.\nAll of thi. 1. not by way of any criticism of anybody. It is\nmerely comment on your letter of May 11, particularly your first\nparagraph.\nCordially yours.\n/ f ! 1 S'\nH. H. Rammers\nDirector\ncc/ Frank Schooley,\nOraydon Ausaius"
