Place of meeting could be\ndetermined by picking a central point.\nI thought the Norman meeting was a good one and the discussion\nshowed good interest on the part of members. It confirms my\npremise that the strength of the organization lies in its\nmembership and the awareness of their belonging. Please call\non me for any help I can give you.\nbest regards to you and your good wife.\nR.J .Coleman,Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee"
