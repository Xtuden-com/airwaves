It is at once a challenge to all broadcasters,\nwhether we be licensees, radio educational directors, or\nteachers in the classroom, alert to the new influences about\nus.\nIt points out anew, and with a rare degree of thoroughness,\nwhat discriminating and intelligent use of radio can bring to the\nclassroom and to the student in after-school hours.\nI will not endeavor to sustain the point here. I ask only that\nthe most skeptical read these observations, independently made\nby a group of teachers who voluntarily sought to find “How To\nUse Radio In the Classroom.”\nThe National Association of Broadcasters and its member\nstations are proud to bring their report into national circulation.\nSincerely,\nPresident,\nThe National Association of Broadcasters.\nWashington, D. C., 1939."
