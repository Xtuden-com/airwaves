Y.\nHOW CAN WE FIT RADIO\nINTO THE CURRICULUM?\n'J' 0 THE teacher whose curiosity about\nradio as a classroom technique has\nled her to listen critically to a number\nof educational broadcasts and tenta¬\ntively to select a given program series as\npeculiarly fitting for her classroom in\none subject area, the next problem be¬\ncomes that of making the necessary ad¬\njustments in the school schedule so that\nthe broadcast time could be freed as\na classroom listening period. This re¬\nscheduling is relatively easier for the ele¬\nmentary school teacher who teaches all\nthe main subjects and has the same boys\nand girls under her guidance during all\nor the greater part of each day, than it\nis for the elementary or high-school\nteacher who teaches but one subject and\nwhose students change from hour to\nhour of each day.\nIn the latter case, it will be possible\nfor only one class to hear the broadcast\nand it may be necessary to change the\ncourse of study requirements for the\nclass listening to the radio program. In\nany case, the whole plan of instruction\nfor that particular class will probably be\nupset. It may as well be assumed that\nthe regular use of a school radio program\nwill necessitate major readjustments in\nthe teaching plan. The teacher using\nradio will begin to ask herself questions\nlike the following: How long shall class¬\nroom discussion of the radio program\ncontinue after the program has been\naudited? Shall assignments be made in\nterms of the radio program? What in¬\nstruction is of most worth? What shall\nbe done about questions raised in the\nchildren’s minds by the radio programs\nwhich are new to the teacher and for\nwhich she has little or no information?\nHow shall the necessary supplemental\nmaterial to the radio program such as\npictures, maps, tables, be gathered and\nused?\nS SUCH questions multiply and re¬\nfuse to answer themselves readily\nmany teachers may become profoundly\ndiscouraged with the complexities of the\nsituation. Against this discouragement\nthe intelligent teacher will need to bal¬\nance the significant positive assets of\nradio, and then with renewed vigor seek\nsolutions to the particular difficulties she\nhas been confronted with. She will weigh,\nfor instance, radio’s possible function as\nan integrating medium between the al¬\nmost infinite array of school subjects so\nseemingly isolated from one another.\nOrdinarily, the neat little bundles of\nabstract generalized information labelled\narithmetic, geography, history, art, etc.,\nbear little promise even under a skill¬\nful teacher of yielding to most children\nan intelligent understanding of life as\nit is lived today. Life is not made up of\ncompartmentalized abstractions.\nHow can history and geography and\nmathematics and literature be integrated\nin the classroom as they are in life? The\npresentation of an historical episode or\nthe reporting of present-day world shak¬\ning events on the international front by\nmodern radio techniques is usually a\ncreative composite drawing upon all\nsubject-matter disciplines and comes\ninto the classroom with all of the variety,\nthe flavor, and freshness of life itself.\nThe radio program cleverly used becomes\na life center toward which laws, prin¬\nciples, and meanings of the various sub¬\nject-matter fields are drawn as explana¬\ntory factors in truly educational fashion.\nThe vista of educational progress made\npossible by the development of educa¬\ntional radio techniques and the intelli¬\ngent utilization of radio in the classroom\nis a broad one toward which little definite\nprogress has been made.\n'J'HE field of experimentation with\nradio is wide open and only as in¬\ndividual teachers all over the land bend"
