They may include reading\nand research, writing reports, collecting\nexhibits, performing experiments, drama¬\ntizations, debates or forums, taking trips,\nor any classroom activity which might be\nstimulated by any other means.\nFollowing are several sample accounts\nof the utilization of school broadcasts.\nThese are presented here not as repre¬\nsenting complete or perfect specimens of\nradio utilization, but only as suggestive\nexamples of what was actually done by\ncertain teachers or certain schools.\nEXAMPLE A\nFifth Grade\nProgram\n“The Sign of Peace,” one of a series\ndesigned for elementary grades. The\nprogram was a dramatization of the\nevents in Argentina and Chile which led\nto the peaceful settlement of their dif¬\nficulties and to the erection of the statue\ncalled “The Christ of the Andes” on the\nborder as a symbol of peace between\nthe two countries.\nPre-Broadcast\nActivities\nThe subject was an¬\nnounced to the class\nseveral days before\nthe broadcast, and dis¬\ncussion brought up the\nwhole matter\nof war and\npeace. Several\nitems were\nselected which\nit seemed im¬\nportant for the\nclass to know\nabout in order\n+~ —the\ni more\nfully. Pupils looked up material on these\npoints and presented them in the form of\nreports during the period just preceding\nthe broadcast. Parts of their reading,\nwriting, English, or library periods were\nused for this activity.\nReports were given on the following\nsubjects:\n1. A discussion of the meaning of cer¬\ntain words, such as “arbitration,”\n“munitions,” etc.\n2. A brief survey of the geography of\nArgentina and Chile\n3. A brief review of the history of the\ntwo countries\n4. Facts about the Statue\n5. The League of Nations\n6. The World Court\n7. The Pan American Union.\nPost-Broadcast Activities\nThe class had been asked to talk over\nwith their parents the question of what\nthe United States should do to avoid war,\nand during the discussion after the broad¬\ncast opinions were expressed on these, as\nwell as other points.\n1. The conquest of Ethiopia\n2. The invasion of China—the Panay\nincident\n3. The war in Spain\n4. The Monroe Doctrine\n5. The Pan-American Union\n6. The part munition makers play\nin war\n7. The effect of martial music and\npropaganda in time of war\n8. The big navy question—could this\ncountry ever be successfully at¬\ntacked?\n9. The League of Nations and the\nWorld Court\n10. Fascism\n11. The question of isolation or co¬\noperation as the best foreign\npolicy for this country\n12. Should the United States protect\nforeign investments in war zones?\nSeveral days later a group of children\nwrote and presented in broadcast form\na short play dramatizing events of the\nwar in Spain, and two boys asked for\nand received permission to hold a debate\non the respective merits of isolation or\ncooperation as the foreign policy of this\ncountry."
