There is no single comprehen¬\nsive answer. Our degree of success in\nsolving such educational problems de¬\npends upon the best possible use of what¬\never teaching techniques and materials\nseem to be of greatest help. Teaching\ntechniques change and multiply and be¬\ncome increasingly effective. Radio is one\nof the newer techniques which is rapidly\nbecoming a very potent force in helping\nteachers achieve the broader purposes\nof education.\nThere are certain unique aspects of\nradio which are not found in most other\naids to learning. First and most im¬\nportant of these is radio’s ability to\nbridge the gap of space. Radio can\nbring the world to the classroom, en¬\nabling pupils to participate in and act¬\nually experience international, national,\nregional, and local situations of great\nscope and significance. History-making\npolitical events, discussions and inter¬\npretations of the news, conferences, de¬\nbates, forums, and talks by authorities\nin every field may now by means of\nradio become part of the school cur¬\nriculum.\nThe qualities of timeliness and authen¬\nticity, which are concomitants of this\nspace-conquering aspect of radio, are\nfactors of vital educational consequence.\nFresh, first-hand accounts or spot broad¬\ncasts of events at the time they are\nhappening may be depended on to\nmotivate and enliven later reading in\nmagazines and books. In no more eco¬\nnomical way may leaders in all forms of\nhuman endeavor be made universally\navailable to bring to the classroom re¬\nliable information and varying points of\nview.\nT HE dramatic and imaginative quality\nM inherent in the spoken word under¬\nlies radio’s greatest contribution to the\ngeneral process of education. The radio\nbroadcast can make instructional mate¬\nrial which is ordinarily considered re¬\nmote from actual experience and hard\nto grasp take on new and vital signifi¬\ncance by the technique of spoken drama.\nThus radio is enabled to expand the\nemotional and intellectual horizons of\nyoung people. Radio can remove the\nhaze of unreality surrounding historic\nevents and persons and enable pupils to\nre-live history imaginatively. Radio can\nmake travelogues out of geographic\nmaterials, transporting the listener vi¬\ncariously to the actual scene, and in¬\nvesting distant everyday life with a\nquality of reality that no written account\ncould ever approach.\nMany phases of modem life difficult\nto present through our ordinary school¬\nroom methods are adaptable to this\ndramatic technique. Such activities as\ncivic government, social welfare, new\ndevelopments in science and technology,\non which only a small amount of\ngraded reading material is available,\nmay be presented effectively by means\nof radio. In the purely cultural or\naesthetic fields of literature and music\nthe contributions and possibilities of\nradio are too obvious for further com¬\nment."
