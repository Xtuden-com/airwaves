C.\nDear Congressman Harris:\nThis is in reply to your letter of March 28 inquiring about the\ninterest of pending federal legislation as it might affect the\nState of Illinois. I wish to express general approval of the\neducational television legislation now being considered by your\ncommittee, although, obviously, I am making no Judgment on the\ndetails of the various proposals before you.\nInterest in and action about educational television has already\nbeen manifested In Illinois. The University of Illinois has had\nan ETV station on the air since 1955# Southern Illinois University\nIs In the process of constructing one, and in Chicago the metro¬\npolitan area Is being served by a community ETV station. Closed-\ncircuit use of television for Instructional purposes has been\ngoing on in some of our schools for some time. For example,\nEvanston Township high school. WTTV in Chicago, in cooperation\nwith the Chicago Board of Education, has been presenting\ninstruction for the Chicago Teacher Colleges.\nI feel that educational television In Illinois would be further\ndeveloped if federal aid and encouragement were to be given. In\nthe long run, television may be one of the important aids in\nmeeting the heavy demands of society on our educational institu¬\ntions at all levels. In Illinois we have six state supported\nuniversities, and many Junior colleges, in addition to our\nelementary and secondary schools. I foresee the use of television\nby many of them in the years ahead.\nI shall be happy to furnish you with additional information at\nanytime it would be helpful*\nSincerely yours.\nFESfb"
