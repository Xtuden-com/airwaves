  "text": "Eastern Kentucky\nNo programming facilities are planned for Eastern Kentucky\nduring the early years. A two-track microwave system leading East out\nof Lexington would probably branch somewhere around Campton. Channels\nused in Eastern Kentucky are:\n19 near Hazard\n24 near Morehead\n14 at Pikeville\n59 in Ashland\nThe twp-track microwave extends all the way into Ashland to\nserve the University Center as well as the transmitter. One track in the\nSoutheast terminates at Hazard; the other extends to Cumberland to serve\nthe Center. Only a single track extends from Campton to Pikeville.\nNorthern Kentucky\nChannel 54, presently assigned to Cincinnati,can almost certain¬\nly be moved to Covington., Located there it can serve the Northern Ken¬\ntucky area. The microwave facilities necessary to carry the signal to the\nchannel 54 transmitter can be made two-track at low cost and provide\nservice to the Covington Center of the University.\nCentral Kentucky\nProductions from Louisville, Bowling Green, Murray, and any\npossible additional studio facilities can be fed into the network for state¬\nwide distribution. The main network studio,, however, will be located at\nLexington. The FCC is considering a petition to \"drop in\" channel 46 in\nLexington. Apparently the request will be favorably received.\nLexington will be, during the first years, the programming cen¬\nter for the Eastern Kentucky region. The main network control board\nwill also be there. Videotaping equipment should also be present.\nOther channels used and their relationship to Lexington would\nbe 29 in Somerset and 15 which is presently operating in Louisville. In¬\ncreases in power and tower height would enable effective coverage of a\nmuch larger area around Louisville than at present.\n- 2 -"
