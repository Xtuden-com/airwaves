The modifiÂ¬\ncations would be to meet technical situations in the television field.\nThe bills on which I am making this statement are: H.R. 9^5 'by\nRepresentative Oren Harris of Arkansas $ H.R. 132 sponsored by Representative\nKenneth A. Roberts of Alabama] H.R. 5099 by Representative Byron 0. Rogers\nof Colorado] H.R. 5536 by Representative Harris McDowell of Delaware]\nH.R. 2910 by Representative Clifford G. Mclntire of Maine] and H.R. 645 by\nRepresentative Hale Boggs of Louisiana.\nThe very fact that these gentlemen come from geographical areas so\nwidely scattered over the country is evidence of the general need for this\nlegislation.\nF,a^b of these bills would authorize, for the purpose of educational\n%\ntelevision, grants to the States of a total not to exceed $1 million in any\nState. These grants would be used to assist public agencies and nonprofit\norganizations to acquire broadcasting apparatus for educational television."
