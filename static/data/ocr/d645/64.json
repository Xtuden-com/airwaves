  "text": "New Roberts Bill Introduced\nH. R. 132 of the 87th Congress, 1st session is a modified\nbill by Congressman Kenneth A. Roberts (D.-Ala.) and has been\nreferred to the Committ# on Interstate & Foreign Commerce. This\nbill retains the provisions of the old Roberts bill as regards the\namounts of money for survey ($10,000) and purchase of facilities\n($1,000,000), but has some interesting and important changes and\nadditions in its other provisions.\nIn the present bill all applications for grants must be\nmade by and through a \"duly constituted State educational tele¬\nvision agency.\" Another change is the requirement of matching\nfunds for the $10,000 survey grants.\nThere is also a new requirement that all projects asking\nfor grants must be approved by the duly constituted State ETV\n4\nagency as having been included in the State Plan which must be\nsubmitted by the State ETV Agency before any State becomes eli¬\ngible for grants. The State ETV Agency is charged with making\ndetermination of priorities in case more applications for grants\nare submitted than funds are available.\nPerhaps the most significant change in the new Roberts bill\nis in the formula for matching grants. It is now proposed that\n50% of the approved cost of a project be paid by Federal funds\nplus an additional allowance of 25% of the cost of any ETV facil¬\nities owned by the applicant on the date of filing. But in no\ncase may the total amount of Federal funds exceed 75% of the\napproved cost of the project.\nIn this new bill ETV facilities are more broadly defined to\ninclude towers, microwave equipment, and video-tape recording"
