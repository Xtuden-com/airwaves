Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue\nWashington, D. C.\nDear Dr. Hill:\nIn reply to your telegram may I say that our Governor has been in\nWashington. He will be advised of your interest.\nI think the most significant activity I could report, and which I\nhope you will be able to use, is the fact that our 1961 state legis¬\nlature passed an appropriation bill providing $46,350 for the support\nof educational television. This money is made available for the\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction to use in contracts with non¬\nprofit corporations willing to provide additional funds for construction\nand other expense incident to the development of educational television\nin our state.\nThe Superintendent of Public Instruction in North Dakota is Mr. M. F.\nPeterson, Bismarck, North Dakota. I do not believe concrete steps\nhave been formalized for the use of this money.\nI might also point out that a committee called the North Central\nEducational Television Association, Inc. has been formed in this state\nto promote educational television in North Dakota. I am a member of\nthat committee, and the chairman is Dr. T. L. Donat, 1702 South 13th St.,\nFargo, North Dakota.\nWe at the University of North Dakota are very interested in extending\nour efforts, now confined to closed-circuit television, to the point\nwhere we can broadcast on channel two reserved for ETV in our area.\nVery truly yours,\nGeorge W. Starcher\nPresident\nGWS:gj"
