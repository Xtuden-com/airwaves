Bennett\nMember of Congress\nWashington 25, D. C.\nDear Mr. Bennett:\nI thought you might be interested in seeing the attached statement\nwhich I gave recently before the Subcommittee in connection with\nthe hearings on Federal aid to educational television. It repre¬\nsents the great interest which the schools and educational interests\nhave in the possibility of developing an educational television ser¬\nvice for the state of Michigan. As you will see from the report,\nit is the southern part of the state that will receive most of the\nservice of this type under the existing and planned conditions.\nOnly through a state network system can these special educational\nservices be made available to the northern part of the state and\nthe upper peninsula. It is in these areas that the greatest need\nexists for additional instructional resources in the fields of science,\nmathematics, language, music and the arts; an it is these special\nresources which television can bring to the schools and the com¬\nmunities most effectively.\nThanks for your interest in education and its services to our\npeople. I know that you will give the question serious consider¬\nation and your best judgment.\nSincerely yours,\nArmand L. Hunter\nDirector of Broadcasting\nALH:jf\nAttachment\ncc: Harold E. Hill-/"
