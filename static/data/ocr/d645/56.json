As of\ntoday, every VHF reserved channel in cities of 300, 000 population and\nover has been activated, with the exception of the one in Kanoas^^Girty,\nwhere an activating group is now hard at work. The remaining assignÂ¬\nments in large cities are UHF in VHF markets, ^nd it is extremely\ndifficult to obtain local citizen support for a station that the viewer at\nhome cannot see unless he spends $50.00 to convert his set to UHF.\nEven here, more often than not, limited operational dollars are obtainable\nfrom schools for whom direct services would be performed. But the\nparticipation of individual citizens is negligible because adult education\nand cultural programming would not be readily available to them. Thus,\nin such cities as New York, Washington, Cleveland and Los Angeles\nthe schools also are denied full-scale service.\nBeyond this, one finds blank spots on the ETV map--\nblank spots that represent the smaller communities and sparsely\nsettled regions where educational and cultural resources also are"
