Only a small minority of the people of the Common¬\nwealth would watch any one of these.\nAfter care has been taken to advertise as widely as possible\nthe offerings of the ETV stations, surveys should be made-to determine\nhow many people actually do watch a given program. Audiences, may be\nbuilt up gradually--and no one would believe that citizens will desert night¬\ntime or week-end commercial TV in droves--but on a long-term basis,\nsurveys should determine if the audience for soil conservation programs\nis changing significantly or if more people watch an opera program than\ndid two years previously. With these types of indicators, wiser choices\ncan be made in program selection.\n- 27 -"
