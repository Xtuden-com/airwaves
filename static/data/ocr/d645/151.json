Hot more than $10,000 would bq\ngranted to any State, The legislation should make clear that multistate,\narea, or regional planning and surveys would be encouraged. Modifications\nof the requirements otherwise applicable on a State basis to facilitate\naccomplishment of this objective should be authorized.\nProjects for construction of ETV facilities.—The legislation should\nauthorize the Commissioner of Education to make grants on a project basis\nunder priorities to be established. The criteria for such priorities\nshould be designed to achieve the prompt and effective use of the available\nchannels, equitable geographical distribution of the facilities throughout\nthe country, and the setting up of the facilities in such a way as to serve\nthe greatest number of people and broadest uses possible. We recommend an\naggregate of $25 million to be authorized over a 4-year period to pay up to\nonerhalf ^the costs of approved projects. This would be matched by the pay¬\nment of one-half the costs by the individual sponsoring agency.\nIf State plans have been made, the grants would proceed in accordance\nwith the State plan. If not, the grants could be made available by the\nCommissioner directly after the State has had a reasonable opportunity to\nprepare such a plan."
