G.\nDear Mr. Dawson:\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters en¬\nthusiastically endorses S.2119, a bill to amend the Federal Property\nand Administrative Services Act of 1949 so as to permit donations\nof surplus property to schools for the aeentally retarded, schools\nfor the physically handicapped, educational television stations\nand public libraries.\nAs the trade association, representing this Nation's 57 tele¬\nvision stations, we believe that adoption of S.2119 would make\navailable to educational television stations across the nation\ncertain surplus properties at a cost commensurate with thfeir\nability to pay. One of the big deterents to a natural growth\nand expansion of educational television in this country has been\nthe high cost of equipment. This bill would permit educational\ntelevision stations to purchase certain items of needed equipment\nfrom surplus government property at a more modest cost, thus en¬\ncouraging the growth and expansion of educational television and\nthereby helping develop a valuable resource In the service of\neducation and the national welfare.\nYour considered support of this legislation is urgently requested.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHskfm"
