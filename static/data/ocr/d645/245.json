W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Mr* Harleys\nDecember 6, 1961\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nDEC 8 1961\nAM pm\nâ– ?l?l ?|1,0|11|12| J|2|8|4|6|(5\nt\nLast week I had a conversation with Jack McBride, station manager of KUON-TV,\nrelative to the Roberts Bill* I gave him three suggestions on how I thought we\nmight be more likely to succeed with our campaign, and he recommended I pass\nthem on to you* They are as follows:\n1. I have contacted Senator George Aiken of our state and have filled\nhim in as to Vermont's need for federal ETV money* He has promised\nto contact the members of the Rules Committee urging them to pass\nthis legislation. It seems to me it would be desirable if each\nSenator would contact the Rules Committee on behalf of his own state*\n2. We are going to get the leaders of the Catholic organizations in\nVermont to write to those members of the Rules Committee who are\nCatholics urging them to vote for this legislation because ETV\nobviously transcends all religious boundaries* We think this\nwould be a good idea for other states to pursue.\n3. If your office could let us know who the doubtful or opposed\nmembers of the Rules Committee are, we could concentrate our\ncampaign on them instead of spreading it over those who are\nalready favorable. Would it be possible for you to send me the\nnames of those who are known to be opposed or neutral to the\nRoberts Bill?\nI hope these suggestions will be helpful to you and to the cause of educational\ntelevision in general.\nSincerely,\nWilliam J. Lewis, Director\nFord Foundation ETV Project in Vermont\nWJLsMD\ncc Jack McBride\nDavid Stewart"
