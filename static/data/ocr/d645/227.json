Flynt, Jr.\nCommittee on Interstate and\nForeign Commerce\nHouse of Representatives\nHouse Office Building\nWashington, D. C»\nDear Representative Flynt:\nThis is to reaffirm our feeling in Alabama that the priming of the\neducational television pump in the United States by Congress at\nthis time is, in our opinion, not only necessary but imperative.\nThrough this means, we feel that we can overcome some of the\nhandicap that we suffer in comparison to other world powers in\nthe field of education at this time.\nTo bolster and bulwark the strength that we already have in edu¬\ncational television in the United States, we further strenuously\nurge that the provision in the original House bill, providing for\nmatching of previously invested capital funds, be re! nstated.\nWe know that moving from known strength to new areas is wise\nprocedure. The pioneer operations of educational television,\nmany of which now need replacement of worn out broadcasting\nequipment, are best bets for carrying forward this great venture.\nYour support of this provision can well mean the strengthening of\nthe bill and possibly making for the strongest feature of the bill.\nWith kindest regards, I am\nSincerely yours,\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager\nRDH/ml\nenc."
