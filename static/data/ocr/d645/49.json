The time is crucial, as the description of the situation in the\nseveral states and many localities indicates. Another postponement, or\nserious delay, at this time would seriously handicap this development for\nyears - in some cases, many years. In addition to this, there is always\nthe threat of losing the reserved channels, or of being too late to drop-in\na necessary channel.\nThe need is now, and a dollar now would be worth several in the\nfuture. There is a time for all progressive developments to move. ETV\nhas reached that critical moment - it moves now, or endangers its total\nprogress"
