C\nDear Representative Dingell:\nWith the recent news about the general education bill, I am\nquite concerned about the ETV or Roberts Bill - HR-i32.\nI am sure you are familiar with the development of educational\ntelevision in our state, particularly since I remember your\nbeing in our studios in the past.\nMany of the mounting pressures in education can be resolved\nby this medium. It is not a panacea, but it will be a major\ntool if we get to use it. I hope you can influence some of\nyour committee colleagues by informing them of the work\nbeing done in Detroit at Wayne State, University of Detroit,\nand the Board of Education.\nPlease put your skillful energies into the fight and secure the\npassage of this important amendment to the 1934 Communications\nAct. If l can be of any help, you know that you need only to ask.\nSincerely yours,\nDr. Lee S Dreyfus\nAssistant Director\nRadio and Television\nLSD:c\nbe: W. Harley"
