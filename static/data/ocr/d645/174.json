This series of social-psychological studies of\nthe influence of television on children is regarded by many as the most\nauthoritative and responsible research in this area.\nAlthough the studies were conducted in England, they have a great per¬\ntinency to our own country . They show, among other things, the effect\nof television on childrens* outlook and the impact upon them of westerns\nand crime and detective series.\nThe entire book is available from the Oxford University Press, but a re¬\nprint of the first four chapters can be obtained from the Television Infor¬\nmation Office, 665 Fifth Avenue, New York 19, New York.\nYou are probably well aware of this publication, but I thought I might\nmention it in case it might have escaped your notice •\nSincerely yours 9\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:rkf"
