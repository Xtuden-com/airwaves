In\ncase it has escaped his notice, I trust that his staff will procure a copy\nof the book, or a reprint of it, in case they do not already have it in\ntheir collection. Senator Dodd seems to be sincere about his investi¬\ngation, though as you know, these things are oftenput on for show or to\ngain notoriety. I sat in for a while the other afternoon when they were\ngiving ABC's Trays a good going over.\nWith reference to the speech association convention - I still don’t know\nfor certain. However, the next couple of weeks should bring a definite\ndecision.\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHtrkf"
