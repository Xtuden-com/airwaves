Furthermore, we would\nprefer that grants be made on a matching basis, for these federal\ndollars can best be used to stimulate, not substitute for, local\ninitiative. If state and/or local institutions, or non-profit foundations\norganized for the purpose, are required to match dollars for conÂ¬\nstruction, they are more likely to recognize their responsibility for\nthe adequate financing of that station* s later operation. At the same\ntime, it is our conviction that there should be no penalty placed upon\nthose who already have shown initiative in the activation of stations.\nHence, we believe that adequate credit in any matching funds formula\nshould be given for prior investment and that grant money should be\navailable for improved power and equipment for existing stations.\nIf Congress fails to pass this legislation, it could well\nmean that many Americans will be deprived, for many years, of the\neducational television service they desire and need--in their elementary\nand secondary schools, in their colleges, and in their homes. We urge\nyour support.\nRespectfully submitted\nJohn F. White"
