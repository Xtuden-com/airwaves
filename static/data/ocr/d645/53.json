All tested means of aiding and\nimproving instruction must be given support and encouragement.\nWe must also be ingenious in using radio and television. They\nare proved instructional tools which have an immense potential\nfor the benefit of American education and the welfare of our\ncountry.\n”1 pledge my cooperation in the development of a national\neducation television policy to help realize the goal of the\nfullest possible educational opportunity for every American.\nThis policy should set forth the basic objectives of the Nation in\nthe field of educational television and it should define respective\nroles of the Federal and other levels of government, broad¬\ncasters, educational institutions and others concerned. Within\nits assigned role Federal assistance in the stimulation of\nthe use of television as an aid to education will have my\nsympathy and support.” V\nI submit, gentlemen, that as statements from the spokesman\nof both the major political parties, these letters indicate\nstrong bi-partisan support for federal assistance in fostering\nthe full development of an establishment for the public benefit\nwhich is recognized by leaders of both parties as a vital force\nin the strengthening of American education and the survival of ^ , JL\nour nation. \\ T~\n£^| > »» •"
