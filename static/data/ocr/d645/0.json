KENNEDY\nOctober 14, 1960\nMr. William G. Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nDupont Circle Building\nWashington, D. C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nIt is a pleasure to extend greetings and good wishes to the 3 6th Convention\nof the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\nYou are meeting at a time when American leadership is challenged as never\nbefore in its history; at a time when our well-being as a nation is in jeopardy. If\nwe are to defend ourselves effectively in a world of international tension and move\nahead, we must rely nc less upon the strength of our educational system than upon\nthe strength of our military establishment. Jefferson attached the utmost importance\nto **the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No other sure foundation can be\ndevised.** he said, #,fcr the preservation of freedom and happiness.** The issue\nof education is clearly bound up with our national stature; one cannot and has not\nthrough American history been achieved without the other."
