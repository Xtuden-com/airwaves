C.\nDear Mr. Hill:\nWe received your telegram on the morning of March 29.\nShortly thereafter Mr. Wheeler, Director of the Legislative Research\nCommission, telephoned Governor Combs's office and informed one of\nthe Governor's assistants of your message. Mr. Wheeler also informed\nthe assistant of the status of our research, as well as of the existence\nof a possible plan for ETV in Kentucky which has been prepared by this\norganization. As of this morning (Monday) we have had no word from\nthe Governor's office. Mr. Wheeler told them, however, that we would\nbe \"standing by\" should they desire further information.\nA copy of the possible plan for ETV in Kentucky has been\nmailed to Len Press who is working at your office. Because it is pri¬\nmarily a service agency for the General Assembly, the Legislative\nResearch Commission probably will confine itself to advising and con¬\nsulting about ETV should any further action be taken by the State Government\nin Kentucky.\nSincerely\nES/pg\nEdward Schten\nSupervisor of Research"
