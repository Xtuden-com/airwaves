  "text": "INTRODUCTION\nAt the request of the Legislative Research\nCommission's Advisory Committee on Educational\nTelevision, a possible plan for a statewide educational\ntelevision network was prepared in March, 1961. Some\nwork had been done toward developing the basic out¬\nline such a network might take even before the com¬\nmittee's request. Since March additional study has\nbeen carried out to refine further the data in the engi¬\nneering field. The engineering data concerning ex¬\npected coverages and channel location are felt to be\nsound.\nProducing educational television is a com¬\nplex operation. It partakes of the education, engi¬\nneering, and administrative worlds. Some idea of\nthis complexity can be gained from the outline on the\nfollowing page which lists functions necessary in ed¬\nucational television.\ni"
