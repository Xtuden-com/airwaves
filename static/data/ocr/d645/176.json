The\nTELEVISION DIGEST report on his investigation, Schramm*s\nand Garry's testimony is patent nonsense. No reference is\nmade to Himmelweit, Vince and Oppenheim's investigation which\nis by far the most significant and contal ns the direct kinds\nof analysis which apparently neither Schramm nor Garry have\nyet given. See \"Effect of Television Values and Outlook,\"\np. 17 and \"The effect of Westerns, and of Crime aid Detective\nSeries,\" p. 20, and subsequent references. These appear in\nTELEVISION AND THE CHILD, long regarded by child, educational\nand general, psychologists as one of the most significant pieces\nof research done to date. The work has long had the blessing\nof Dr. Eleanor Maccoby of Stanford, a recognized international\nauthority in the field. I am sure you have the reprint of the\nfirst four chapters of this work (ava lable from the TIO Office)\nif not the entire work. Will be pleased to loan you either"
