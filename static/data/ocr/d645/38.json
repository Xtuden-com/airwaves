  "text": "-5-\nConnecticut - In 1958 the Legislative Council, acting on previous\ninstructions of the legislature, recommended funds for experiment in ETV.\nPreviously the General Assembly had appropriated $150,000 for ETV programming.\nFlorida - The legislature first appropriated money for the investigation\nof ETV in 1953 and four years later established a permanent ETV commission and\ninitially appropriated $600, 000 for the development and construction of a state\nnetwork. In the meantime, the three large metropolitan areas of the state and\nthe two state universities planned and constructed stations on the five available\nETV channels. The costs of the university stations were derived from state\nsources, and the funds for the stations in Miami, Tampa, St. Petersburg, and\nJacksonville came from cooperative public school funds, private philanthropy,\npublic donations and special state grants • Three more much-needed stations are\nnow being planned for the immediate future, but capital outlay financing is still\na serious problem.\nGeorgia - ETV has been encouraged in Georgia since 1953, when funds\nwere appropriated for a Continuing Education Center at the University of Georgia.\nIn 1958 the Atlanta public schools put a station on the air and developed a pro¬\ngram service for the schools that is now being widely shared. In 1960 the\nUniversity of Georgia at Athens went on the air with a comprehensive ETV service.\nThe State Board of Education has construction permits on channels at Way cross\nand Savannah, and one is being planned in the western part of the state at\nColumbus. If sufficient state funds had been available all of these stations\nwould now be in operation; but even so this only touches the need for ETV in\nGeorgia"
