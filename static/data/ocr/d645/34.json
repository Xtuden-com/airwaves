Harley, before this Committee of the Eighty-Sixth\nCongress.\nThe need for the provisions of this legislation has become more acute\nsince it was last considered, and in further support of this proposed legislation\nthe Association herewith re-emphasizes certain statements and presents addi¬\ntional information for the consideration of the Committee.\nThe crisis confronting education in this country regarding the lack of\nfacilities and teachers to cope with ever mounting enrollments has been too well\ndocumented to need repeating here. By increasing the productivity of good\nteachers, and making adjustments possible in teacher loads and functions,\neducational television can greatly assist with this problem.\nEducational television also provides a type of general public programming\nservice which commercial television so far has not been able to offer in any¬\nthing like adequate quantity or quality. Educational television makes the best\nminds of America’s great educational institutions available to the whole country.\nIt expands the public service potential of state and federal agencies. This\nsort of programming provides eloquent testimony of the social, educational and\ngeneral public service responsibility of educational television as it is emerging\nin the United States."
