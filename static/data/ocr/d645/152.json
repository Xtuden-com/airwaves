We do not believe Federal funds are\nwarranted for this limited type of facilities.\nother pieces of legislation\nResearch and Experimentation. —.Two\nrecommended by the Kennedy administration could round out Office of Educa-\ntion services to educational television.\nOne is the \"Educational Assistance Act of 1961\" which provides for\nnew demonstration programs to meet special education problems. Such pro¬\ngrams might include the use of a new media such as television.\nThe other is currently in progress—the provision under title VII\nof the National Defense Education Act whereby research is being carried on\nto evaluate and aid in the development of television and other audio-visual\neducation media. Resident Kennedy has recommended that the National\nDefense Education Act, which expires next July 1, be extended and improved.\nETV Has Proven Its Worth\nEducational television has proven its worth. More than 50 careful\nstudies provide evidence that anything that can be taught by lecture and\ndemonstration in the classroom can be taught at least as well by television.\nAs one example, a complete junior college curriculum has been on the\nair for 5 years in Chicago. It has been taken by thousands of students.\nTests have proven that these televised courses have brought students to the\nlevel of skill attained by classroom practice.\nThere have been spectacular demonstrations that television can do\ncertain instructional tasks much better than they can be done in the\nclassroom."
