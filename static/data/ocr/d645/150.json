New York State conducts its extensive programs of ln-school\ntelevision over a commercial station. A study is now underway to find out\nif frequency allocations are available to set up a regional educational\ntelevision network in this highly populated area-which, incidentally,\nis exceptionally rich in education resources.\nAll the VHP channels reserved by the FCC in areas of more than\n300,000 population have now been assigned.\nThe task of the next k years will be stimulating new VHF\nstations in low-population areas and in making use of the UHF channels\nin all areas needing ETV.\nWhere it is in use, ultra high frequency television has been well\naccepted. Its adoption has been hampered by the fact that the manufacturers\nhave not produced many sets capable of receiving UHF. However, it is\nentirely possible to produce TV sets which receive all frequencies.\nThe problem now being faced by this committee is to make it possible\nfor the remaining bands to be used in such a fashion as to best serve\nthe population which does not yet have access to educational television.\nIt is obvious from the situation I have described that the plans and"
