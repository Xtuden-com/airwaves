C.\nDear Congressman Harris:\n1 would like to supplement the information given you in\nmy letter of April 14 concerning the development of educational\ntelevision in Texas.\nThe Texas Education Agency is authorized to plan and\ncoordinate the development of educational television services in\nthe State. Ite accustomed method of operation Is to undertake\nsuch development by the formation of advisory commissions and\ncommittees, by conducting studies, and by formulating leadership-\ntype proposals which are accepted by local authorities and stateÂ¬\nwide organisations. Just this week it is launching a large\nstatewide demonstration project in the use of new educational\nmedia in which educational television plays a prominent role.\nFinancing, erecting, and operating educational television\nstations Is a local responsibility in this State. A ruling of our\nAttorney General makes it clear that local school districts and\njunior college districts have legal power to use tax funds for the\npurchase of educational television services. A new educational\ntelevision station is soon to go on the air in the San Aatoaio-Austla\narea with a large share of its operating funds coming from such\nsupport.\nIn brief, the State of Texas has adequate machinery to\nformulate a statewide plan for educational television and to\nallocate any funds which become available for the construction,\nequipment, and operation of non-profit educational broadcasting."
