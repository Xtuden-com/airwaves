ERICKSON\nDean of Television Instruction\nCHICAGO CITY JUNIOR COLLEGE\nThis is a statement in support of Federal grants to the several states\nto aid them in initiating and expanding educational service through non-profit\nbroadcast television channels.\nSince 19£6 the Chicago Board of Education, through the Chicago City\nJunior College, has been utilizing broadcast television to bring a unique\neducational service to the six million residents of Chicagoland. In a real\nsense, the walls of the institution had been expanded to a circle with a\nradius of over 50 miles. This circle bounds the signal area of WTTW,\nChannel 11, Chicago’s non-profit community owned educational channel.\nIn the Spring of 1961, 2^17 adult students are registered for credit in\nnine standard college courses. A TV College Information Folder describing\nthese nine courses is supplied to the Committee as Exhibit A. When the 2^17\npart-time enrollments are combined, they become equal to 7U2 full-time\nenrollments. This television college requires no campus except the occasional\nuse of classrooms in the Chicago City Junior College. If this group were to\nbe taught conventionally, a campus costing several millions of dollars would\nbe required.\nOver h0% of Chicago's adult television students are interested in teach¬\ning as a new career. Among these are many homemakers who attend college only\nbecause instruction is brought into their living rooms by television. They\nhope to become practicing teachers after their children are grown and able to\ncare for themselves. These mature students will help meet the desperate short¬\nage of qualified teachers in the coming years."
