Hill\nAdministrative lice President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nConnecticut Avenue\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Harold:\nJfy reply to your telegram is delayed because our secretary resigned\nlast week because of ill health and my new secretary just started today.\nI took the matter up with the State Department of Education. Immediately\nit ended up with my roughing out a letter from Govenor Ellington\nto Oren Harris and preparing a slight more detailed report to be sent\nby Joe Morgan, Commissioner of Education.\nPassage of the House bill and signing by the President would be a\ngreat boon to our state. It would mean we in Nashville would\nhave Channel 2 on with full power. It would mean a step in Knoxville\nvery soon, and would certainly hasten the arrangements in Chattoonoga.\nKeep me posted.\nWegener, General Manager\nyours,\nEW/sm"
