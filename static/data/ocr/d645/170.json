C.\nDear Bill and Harolds\nI’ve Just read the June issue of the Special Washington Report and\nI’m curious as to Aether a strict reSin^ bf Ribico^1©\"\"raaaoendAtlan\nfor $25 million was based on an average of $125,000 for each of the\napproximately 200 unactivated reserved channels\" wouldn’t deprive all\nactivated channels of any aid.\nWGTE is activated, but we certainly need much more than $125,000 to\nbring us up to full power and up to proper broadcast standards. Would\nwe be ineligible for a grant! Certainly there are other operating\nstations who face the same problems: equipment sub-standard, insufficient\nin depth, and needing funds beyond local sources. If this formula is\nmerely a means for estimating needs and not a pattern for distribution,\nI can accept It. Otherwise, not. It rewards the laggards who can\nafford the cost and penalises those Who with considerable effort have\njust managed to get into broadcast.\nSincerely,\nHDL/jb"
