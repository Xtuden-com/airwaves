The study has just been completed and plans approved for\na state network of transmitters and translators which will serve most of the\npeople of Montana at a very economical cost. Funds are not now available\nto proceed, but the whole plan could be achieved with Federal assistance.\nNebraska - ETV has been encouraged here since 1953. The State\nUniversity put its station on the air in 1954, and has since participated in\nextensive planning for the rest of the state. A state plan has been devised\nwhich will provide basic ETV service to most of the people in Nebraska, and\nan assignment of five more channels strategically located has been requested\nof the FCC.\nNew Hampshire - Here the legislature established an ETV Commission\nin 1953. Through its efforts a non-profit corporation was formed to provide\nfinancial support for the construction of a station. As a result, an ETV channel\nwas activated at Durham in 1959. At present facilities are limited and further\ncapital outlay needed.\nNew lersev - This state did some fine pioneering in using television\nfor education. In 1953 the legislature established a Commission for ETV and\nappropriated $75,000 for experimental work.
