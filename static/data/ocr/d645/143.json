C.\nDear Congressman Harris:\nI would llks to supplement the information given you in\nmy letter of April 14 concerning the development of educational\ntelevision in Texas.\np\nThe Texas Education Agency is authorized to plan and\ncoordinate the development of educational television services in\nthe State. Its accustomed method of operation is to undertake\nsuch development by the formation of advisory commissions and\ncommittees, by conducting studies, and by formulating leadership-\ntype proposals which are accepted by local authorities and state¬\nwide organizations. Just this week it is launching a large\nstatewide demonstration projset in the use of new educational\nmedia in which educational television plays a prominent role.\nFinancing, erecting, and operating educational television\nstations is a local responsibility in this State. A ruling of our\nAttorney General makes it clear that local school districts and\njunior college dletrlcte have legal power to use tax funds for the\npurchase of educational television services. A new educational\ntelevision station is soon to go on the air in the San Antonio-Austin\nwith a large share of its operating funds coming from such\nsupport.\nI® briaf, the State of Texas has adequate machinery to\nformulate a statewide plan for educational television and to\nallocate any funds which be corns available for the construction,\nequipment, and operation of non-profit educational broadcasting."
