KNOW, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL\n^ScATIONS COMMISSION .TOTHE COMMITTEE ON\nINTERSTATE AM) FOREIGN COMMERCE, UNITED STATES\nSENATE, ON S. 205, 87TH CONGRESS, A BILL TO\nEXPEDITE THE UTILIZATION OF TELEVISION TRANSÂ¬\nMISSION FACILITIES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AM)\nCOLLEGES AND IN ADULT TRAINING PROGRAMS\nMarch 7, 1961\nHaving assumed office on March 2, 1961, I was unable to connect\non the above bill at the same time as my colleagues. But because of the\nimmense importance I attach to this legislation, I take the liberty of\ntransmitting this statement to you in the hope that it may still be\nconsidered by the Committee.\nI join Conmissioner Hyde in urging the use of Federal funds for\neducational television. I believe, with him, that a widely available\nand adequately financed non-commercial educational television service is\nvitally necessary to improve our educational and conmunications system.\nThrough such a service, our nation may have an unparalleled opportunity\nfor education, for experimental programming, for real diversification of\nprogram fare, and for cultural advancement. In view of the present lack\nof funds in many areas to meet station construction costs, I believe that\nFederal aid is needed, particularly to advance the date of construction\nand to permit extensive rather than minimal operation. I recognize, of\ncourse, that the amount of funds to be allocated this project as against\nother worthwhile legislative programs is a matter for the judgment of the\nCongress. But I do wholeheartedly endorse the use of Federal funds to\naid in establishing or improving educational television broadcasting\nfacilities,"
