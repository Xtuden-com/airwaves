Lamb\nDirector, WTDS\nRadio-TV Education Dept.\nToledo Public Schools\n1901 West Central\nToledo 6, Ohio\nDear Harry:\nI can understand your concern about the provisions of the Ribicoff\napproach. The new version of the Magnus on - Roberts bill, which\nhas just been reported out by the Sucbommittee, and it ties in fairly\nclosely with his recommendations. In particular, it lays special\nemphasis upon the use of these funds for activating the unused channels.\nOn the other hand, it does not preclude the use of these funds for ex¬\npanding or extending existing stations. If the state survey on the “need\nfor and utility of additional educational television broadcasting\nfacilities\" indicates that a part of this development requires the im¬\nprovement of existing educational television facilities, such distri¬\nbution of funds would be approved by the Commissioner.\nThe pertinent language in the bill is as fbllows: “The Commissioner\nshall base his determination as to whether to approve applications for\ngrants ... on criteiia set forth in regulations and designed to achieve\n(1) prompt and effective use of all educational television channels re¬\nmaining available, (2) equitable geographical distribution of educational\ntelevision broadcasting facilities throughout the States, and (3) provision\nof educational television broadcasting facilities which will serve the\ngreatest number of persons and serve them in as many areas as possible,\nand which are adaptable to the broadest educational uses.\""
