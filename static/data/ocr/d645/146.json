State matching of Federal funds on a 50-50 basis.\n2* State surveys of the needs for educational television and\nState plans for a construction program.\nWe recommend the inclusion of Buch provisions in the legislation*\nI do not believe that ETV stations will have enough vitality to survive\nunless the areas they serve show enough interest and put up at least half\nthe funds* And I consider the most careful planning absolutely essential\nif the entire country is to be served by educational television.\nFor the surveys and plans we recommend the same amount mentioned in\nthe three bills, an authorization of $520,000, with not more than $10,000\nto be granted to any State0\nFor construction, we recommend the authorization of $25 million\nwhich when matched by the States would mean an investment which will average\nabout $1 million for each State, which is included in all the bills*\nThe total authorization for Federal grants in the 4 years would thus\nbe $25,520,000*\nIn addition, and for the technical reasons which will be developed\nin this testimony, we recommends\n1 * That provisions be included whereby State plans may be developed\ncooperatively into interstate or regional plans.\n2* That construction grants be made on a project-by-project and not\n& State-by-State basis*\nAny one of the bills now before you could be modified to meet our\nrecommendations"
