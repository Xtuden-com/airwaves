'There are 35 states which have either state or local\nplanning for new EN development which is ccastingent upon Federal assistance*\nIn many of ; these, planning has advanced to a critical stage, and prolonged\ndelay would he disastrous, and ia any event would retard beginning develop¬\nment thgou&h another biennium. A listing of some cf these states will\nbetter illustrate the situation:\nKANSAS - this state has a state plan to provide much-needed ETV\nfacilities to 85# of its population. She legislature can see its my clear\nto provide only l/6 of the development money needed in the hope that Federal\nAssistance will add enough to make an encouraging start. Belay now win\njeopardize two years* work, and may cause the loss of several of the proposed\nchannels to coasaercial interests. One such channel is already slipping\naway from the State schools.\nNEBRASKA - this state has a plan similar to the Kfcasas plan, but it\nis entirely dependent upon taking immediate advantage of specific unassigned\nVHF channels. Hie State*# claim is now being contested, and lack of funds\nor delay in development will undoubtedly cause the loss of these channels.\nHere, as la Kansas, the loss of one or two channels would wreck the uhotle\nState Ban.\nNEW MEXICO - this state has built one TSUV station and has plans\ndeveloped to furnish service to all the schools in the state, but it cannot\nbuild the other 2 stations without assistance, and again delay endangers the\nnecessary channels."
