C.\nD*ar Congressman Harris:\nI would like to supplement the information given you in\nmy letter of April 14 concerning the development of educational\ntelevision in Texas. |\nThe Texas Education Agency is authorized to plan and\ncoordinate the development of educational television services in\nthe State. Its accustomed method of operation is to undertake\nsuch development by the formation of advisory commissions and j\ncommittees, by conducting studies.1 and by formulating leadership*\ntype proposals which ars accepted by local authorities and state¬\nwide organisations. Just this wssk it is launching a largo !\nstatewide demonstration project ia the use of new educational j\nmedia la which educational television plays a prominent role.\nFinancing, erecting, and operating educational television\nstations is a local responsibility in this State. A ruling of our\nAttorney General makes it clear that local school districts and\njunior college districts have legal power to use tax funde for the\npurchase of educational television services. A new educational\ntelevision station is soon to go on the air in the San Antonio-Austin\narea with a Urge share of its operating funds coming front such\nsupport.\nIn brief, the State of Texas has adequate machinery to\nformulate a statewide pUm for educational television and to\nallocate any funds which become available for toe construction,\nequipment, and operation of non-profit educational broadcasting.\ni\n}\nT' ' !
