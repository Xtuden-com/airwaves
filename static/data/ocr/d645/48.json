  "text": "-15-\nMontana - this state, with a foundation grant, has developed a\nvery economical and effective state plan. Its development depends on out¬\nside assistance, and the key channel could be lost by delay.\nTennessee - has two channel 2*s which are being eyed by commercial\ninterests - these are part of a state plan which must have Federal assistance\nto get off the ground.\nFlorida. Georgia. Alabama - all have advanced State Plans and large\ndevelopments, but all need assistance to preserve their gains and meet their\nincreasing needs.\nMississippi. Arkansas. Wyoming & Idaho - all are just beginning tp\nget organized for ETV. Their only hope is outside assistance, and inordinate\ndelay will set them back considerably.\nNew York. Michigan. Wisconsin & Texas - have all made good\nstarts, but are now, for diverse reasons, at a critical point where no effective\nprogress can be made without some help. These are comparatively rich\nstates, but at this point seed money is essential; and delay in all of these\nareas puts serious pressure on the reserved channels.\nNineteen states now have more or less elaborate State Plans for ETV,\nor are in the planning stage. In every instance some phase of the planning\nhinges upon immediate Federal assistance.\nThere are several states, such as West Virginia and Idaho, where\ninterest has been kindled only because of the hope of the proposed legislation „\nThese states cannot possibly have any development through local resources\nunless and until outside assistance is available. Postponement now would\nprobably destroy the possibility for years."
