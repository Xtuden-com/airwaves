Bo domestic challenge which faces us is more crucial\nthan education.\nEducational television could help us catch up on our school work,\nin which, X regret to say, we are behind. It could focus sustained\nnational attention on music, art, literature and drama.j\nIt could help us to make scientific progress.\nAnd educational television will advance as science advances.\nAlready an experiment is underway on an airborne instructional\nprogram in the Midwest, We look forward to a future in which information\nand instruction may be conveyed from nation to nation through installations\nin outer space.\nPresident Kennedy in his education message of February 21 this year\nsaid: \"Our twin goals must be a new standard of excellence in education—\nand the availability of such excellence to all who are willing and able to\npursue it.\"\nThe achievement of those two goals could be hastened by the legislation\nnow before you. Television is as great in its possibilities of increasing the\nexcellence of education as the invention of printing was in its time. And no\nmedium has ever equaled television in availability to all.\nOf course we all understand that television will never do all of\nour education. It will never supplant person-to-person and classroom\nteaching. Television is simply a powerful Instrument to open up many more\nvistas in the lifelong educational process."
