We'd like to include more original material\nbut unfortunately people don't send it to us although they promise, so again\nwe ask you to help.\nWe believe you’ll be interested in the Canadian Broadcasting\nCorporation paper included herein. We have another from CBC on \"Standardization\nand Control of the Kinescope Recording Process\" which is not included due to\nits length and more limited appeal. However, we’ll send it to you upon\nrequest.\nCecil S. Bidlack\nOctober 12, 1956"
