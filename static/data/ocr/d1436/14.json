At\none glance, the designer would know that none of the colors of any single\nchart could be combined in a setting where separation of tonal areas was\nrequired. If one of these equal value charts is placed before a TV camera\nall chips appear as the same shade of gray.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt a cost represented by the total cost of one reflectometer, one\nMunsell Library Edition and the new KETMA. gray scale test pattern any TV\nstation could be in a position to calibrate paints, fabrics and other\nmaterials without turning on a camera. Materials, particularly draperies\ncould be measured before they were purchased, and set construction or props\nprovided by outside commercial agencies could be checked before camera day.\nPaper and paste-up materials used by graphic arts groups could be pre-checked\nfor tonal separation. It should be remembered that such calibrations will\nonly be accurate for flat-lighting in the studio. Spotlight techniques may\ncause the contrast range in the studio to become greater or less than the\ncalibration results would indicate."
