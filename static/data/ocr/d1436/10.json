They supplied the\ntrack and hangers for the draperies which run around three sides of\nthe University of Michigan TV studio. If you're interested we suggest\nyou write asking for their catalog.\nVern Weber is using a different type of scenery clamp than the\nscrew type \"C\" clamp ordinarily seen in TV studios. It's called a\nColts Clamp and is made by the Batavia Clamp Co., Batavia, N.Y.\nIt comes in various sizes from 4-18 inches in length. Clamping\naction is effected by a cam instead of a screw; consequently its\naction is very fast. A sliding arm also makes the clamp adjustable\nforusein clamping objects of varying widths together, (see sketch)\n_^ cam\n- Sl/O/A/G AkM\nModular Units of scenery are also employed at the University\nof Michigan TV studio. These are constructed by building a frame\nof 1\" x 3\" wood covered with 4* x 8’ sheets of upson board or ply¬\nwood. No scenery jacks are used; instead 1/2\" pipe 13 inches long\nand pipe flanges are employed which hold the flat approximately one\nfoot off the floor. For stability a flat steel plate, 3/8\" thick and\n6\" wide by 18\" long to which 3/8\" iron rods a foot long have been\nwelded, are used. The pipes and bottom flange slide down over the\nrods and the plates are turned at right angles to the plane of the flat\nfor stability, (see sketch on next page)\nHt\\NDL£"
