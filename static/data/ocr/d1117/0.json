The attendance-\nbreaking meeting was geared to change . . .\nchange in technology, change in methods and\ntechniques of research, change in instruc¬\ntional TV, change in the educator’s use of\nthe broadcast media and change in the role\ngovernment is and will be playing in the\nfuture of educational broadcasting.\nSome fifty speeches and presentations, a\ndozen panel and discussion groups, numer¬\nous business meetings and demonstrations\n^'\"~N in fields related to educational broadcasting\njammed the busy optimism-dominated three-\ncJay schedule.\nIn addition, 52 manufacturers with more\nthan two and a half million dollars worth\nof equipment had displays at the conven¬\ntion.\nAt the semi-annual business meeting of\nthe NAEB Board of Directors E. G. Bur¬\nrows, manager, WUOM/WVGR, Univer¬\nsity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, was elected\nchairman of the NAEB board. The newly\nelected vice chairman is Robert Schenkkan,\ndirector, South West Texas ETV Council,\nUniversity of Texas, Austin.\nIn over-all convention actions, the NAEB\nadopted resolutions praising the Ford Foun¬\ndation’s proposal for a communications\nsatellite system and the soon-to-be-released\nreport of the Carnegie Commission on edu¬\ncational broadcasting. A special task force\nwas set up to study the complete reorgani¬\nzation of the NAEB’s internal structure\nand a committee will report to the NAEB’s\nBoard of Directors in the spring. President\nof the NAEB, William G. Harley, in his\nannual report, stressed the rapid growth of\neducational broadcasting noting that NAEB\nhas its largest membership to date ....\n2,272. He also cited the NAEB’s $800,000\nannual budget and plans for an expanded\npublic relations program, new research de¬\npartment, a new monthly publication, “Edu¬\ncational Broadcasting Review,” replacing\nthe “NAEB Journal,” and a special task\nforce to strengthen regional meetings.\nThe development of an ETS five-year\nprojection “model” for second system edu¬\ncational TV broadcasting was revealed to\ndelegates for the first time by C. Scott\nFletcher, executive consultant to the ETS\nDivision of the NAEB. He predicted that\nwithin five or six years at least 350 oper¬\nating ETV broadcast stations will be on\nthe air. There are 122 stations in operation\nnow. Mr. Fletcher stated the belief that\nthe stations will be fully interconnected on\na nationwide basis as well as suitably inter¬\nconnected on an interstate and regional\nlevel.\nA four-point political action program to\nassure federal financial aid to educational\nradio similar to that now available to edu¬\ncational TV through the ETV Facilities\nAct was announced at the convention by\nJerrold Sandler, executive director of\nNAEB’s NER Division. He told delegates\nthat discussions are currently underway with\nthe FCC to develop a nationwide allocations\ntable to cover the reserved FM frequen¬\ncies. The basic approach to the plan will\nbe to identify statewide and regional needs\nthrough state networks, thus assuring the\nmost productive and efficient use of the\navailable FM spectrum.\nFred Friendly, TV consultant to the\nFord Foundation, New York City, told a\npacked convention Keynote session that the\nFord proposal for a domestic satellite sys¬\ntem will make 1967 the year when educa¬\ntional broadcasting will be on its way to\nnational live quality programing. He urged\ndelegates to bring the excitement and chal¬\nlenge of our world into the classroom\nthrough radio and television. He further\nurged broadcasters to review their methods\nof duplicating and distributing NET pro¬\ngrams and termed the present method ob¬\nsolete.\nMr. Friendly saw the satellite system as\na means of providing “an electronic turn¬\npike with exits and entrances for every\nstation and every schoolhouse in the coun¬\ntry.” When the “turnpike” becomes a real¬\nity, he said, non-commercial television would\nbe able to provide a second service found\nnowhere else since the three commercial\ntelevision networks’ broadcasts are so simi¬\nlar that nationally they constitute a single\nservice.\nDr. Donald Emery, superintendent of\nschools, Scarsdale, N. Y., called on broad¬\ncasters to use more creativity in the de¬\nvelopment of the individual and said that\nAmerican education looks to technology to\nmake more time available for teachers to\ndo things other than those which machines\ncan do as well. If the public is to insist on\na top public education system, it can be\nachieved only by embracing technology to\nthe advantage of learning, Dr. Emery said.\n“The teacher, the chalk board, and a few\nbooks and a little laboratory equipment can¬\nnot meet the demand for excellence. Teach¬\ners cannot keep in mind enough information\n.... They cannot be sufficiently even-\ntempered and patient. Machines, devices and\nmechanical aids in many respects can do\nand be this way,” he said.\nDr. Paul A. Miller, assistant secretary\nfor education, Department of Health, Edu¬\ncation and Welfare, assured delegates at\nthe annual banquet that HEW is, like the\nbroadcasters themselves, waiting for the\nstudy of the Carnegie Commission, the re¬\nview of the Ford Foundation proposal and\nthe results of hearings which will be held\nby Sen. Warren G. Magnuson. He said it\nwas the role of non-commercial media to\nassist substantially in improving the condi¬\ntion of man. He noted that facilities alone\ncannot do the job and stressed the need\nfor more well trained management person¬\nnel. “Television in the university setting\ncannot be fully effective unless it becomes\nan integral part of management consider¬\nations,” he said.\nPrior to Dr. Miller’s address, E. Wil¬\nliam Henry, former chairman of the FCC,\nreceived a distinguished service award\nfrom NAEB. It was also announced that\nMr. Henry would join the association’s\npublic Board of Directors. Other members\nof the public Board are Mr. Fletcher, Fred\nHarvey Harrington, president of the Uni¬\nversity of Wisconsin, and Irving Harris,\nChicago business executive and a director\nof the Chicago Educational Television As¬\nsociation.\nDuring Mr. Henry’s tenure as FCC chair¬\nman, the Educational Broadcasting Branch\nof the FCC was expanded, a close liaison\nbetween the FCC and HEW in the admin¬\nistration of the ETV Facilities Act was\ndeveloped, and all-channel receiver legisla¬\ntion was passed by Congress.\nA citation, accepted by Kansas City\nMayor Ilus W. Davis, was also presented\nto Former President Harry S. Truman.\nPresident Harley, in making the award,\nstressed President Truman’s contributions\n1"
