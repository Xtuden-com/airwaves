This does not comply with\nthe first paragraph of the agreement which requires that the tapes be\nrecorded at 15 inches per second. However, since the 7 inches per\nsecond recordings checked thus far seem to be of acceptable quality and\nare not music programs, we regard this as a relatively minor consider¬\nation, and we have not as yet registered any objection with the Paoifica\nFoundation, We would be less apt to let this consideration pass by in\nthe case of music programs®\nPerhaps the three series listed as \"Still Under Consideration\"\nshould not be regarded as breaches of agreement unless the series are\napproved and recordings of these and the remaining program hours of the\nthree series do not come to the NASB as recordings at 15 -inches per\nsecond, The agreement does not specifically state a required recording\nspeed for audition tapes."
