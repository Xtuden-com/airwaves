Griffith©\nFund for Mult Education\n1444 Wentworth Avenue\nPasadena 5, California\nD^ar Bills\nBor© la a report on the currant status of the Center-NAEB\ngrant program© from KPPA. It seems improbable that KPFA will be able\nto supply the HAEB with the \"approximately 50 program hours\" called for\nin the NAES-Paelflea Foundation memorandum agreement of June 29, 1954,7\nby the final deadline of September 1, 1954, let alone by the original\ndeadline of July 1, 1954* However, from the standpoint of the NAEB\nNetwork distribution schedule it would not be imprudent to extend the\nfinal deadline two month© for 12-15 program hours past the first 25,\nand perhaps even farther for the remaining 10 hours, though the NAKB\nwould like to have all programs as soon as possible, of course. We do\nfeel that they’ve tried sincerely, and we are being aa patient, tolerant,\nand helpful ae possible.\nI hope the following data sheet and notes will make the situ¬\nation dear.\nRegards,\nHarry J* Skoraia\nExecutive Director\nBJSswo\nEno."
