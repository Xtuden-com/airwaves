Although, in the abstract,\nI am certain of the appropriateness of this commitee for the\npresent function, I confess it had been my understanding that\nthe Advisory Committee to the Center would be the 1TAEB group\nfunctioning in this grant, and I had looked forward especially\nto sitting down, not only with yourself, but for example with\nGeorge Probst, with whom I have already spent considerable\ntime discussing possible program activity under this arrange¬\nment. Because of my confusion about the constituency of the\nvarious FAEB committees, I have also had the impression that\nSi Siegel would be sitting in on our discussions. In any\nevent, I do hope that George can be invited to join us for\nthe discussion in Chicago. And I am very pleased at the pro¬\nspect of becoming acquainted with the other NAEB officers of\nthe committee.\nSincerely yours\nLewis Hill\nLH:mv\ncc: Graydon Ausmus\nBox 2002\nUniversity, Alabama\nTELEPHONE AShberry 3-6767\nA NON-PROFIT EDUCATIONAL CORPORATION\nLEWIS HILL, Chairman\nRICHARD MOORE, Vice-Chairman\nELEANOR McKINNEY, Secretary\nKARL ZAPF, Treasurer"
