This I\nunderstand to be the nature of the contract between the\nKASB and KPFA. The Hamilton group faces a loss of support\nby the FAE and a loss of confidence by the HAEB, and I\nwould assume that KPFA faces bankruptcy.\nI was never under the impression that Lew Hill would\ntake the matter to court and I have written him that I\nam were be would never do that.\nX provide all of this for your confidential information,\nand would be interested to hear how things dsvelop in\nthis extraordinary situation.\nSincerely yours.\nGeorgs 5.
