I am holding about one hundred copies\nin reserve in case you wish to circulate them to the\nmembership of NAEB. Would you please let me know if\nyou would like the copies.\nI just spoke to Cy Langlois of Langworth and he tells\nme that when April or May rolls around, he will have\nfive hundred libraries of his 16” material. He seems\nvery friendly to the idea of making some kind of\nspecial deal and rate with Additional states*** so if\nyou are interested in pursuing this aspect of our\nconversation, you might get in touch with him.\nAlso, when Ed Gruskin, who is head of radio for SCA\nin Europe was in town, he played for me a fifteen-\nminute show called ” SALUTE* ID THE WORKERS”, which is\nproduced in various languages all over Europe. This\nprogram consists basically of statistics on industry\nin short capsules, plus folk music of the various\ncountries. The title could be changed to one of\nyour own and you could have -this series exclusively\nfor members of NAEB. If you like, I will send you\na record of it so that you can better judge its\ncontent.\nWith all good wishes.\nTed Co tt\nVice President and\nDirector of Programs\nTC:vlj\n1130 on your dial\n24 hours a day"
