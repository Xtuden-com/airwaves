  "text": "McCarty, Schoolsy, Skomia, Siegel, Moll, Page 2, September 4, 1950\nthree categories. Simple multiplication and addition\nbrought the figures in lines 12, 13, and 14. By adding\nthe figures in line 14, we arrive at the grand total of\n$14,625, which I have broken down into the budget on\npage 2.\nUne 2 of the budget is based on the idea that the tech¬\nnician would make at least 15 copies at a time. Thus\nfor 45 stations he could, with considerable luck, duplicate\neach day's operation in 3$ to 4 hours. This, on a 5-day\nweek, would mean 16 to 18 hours per week or around 2/5\nof his time. This is an optimum operation which undoubtedly\nwould not be achieved for several weeks. Additional time\nfor the man would have to be paid for out of the reserve.\nLine 3, the wages, is baaed on the same idea. By using\nfilm-type shipping cases, which are accounted for in Une\n6, this would not be toe much of a chore. The 35# mailing\ncost mentioned in line 4 Is purely arbitrary and based\nsolely on our experience, line 5 calls for 20 tapes per\nstation. It is anticipated that this would allow one\nweek for mailing from the distribution center to each\nstation, one week for playing at that station, one week\nfar return, and one week for remaking before mailing.\nIn line 6, the film-type shipping cases are more expensive\nbut more than make up for their cost in ease of handling.\nWe have shipped tapes this way for our School of the Air\nbroadcasts this year and find it very satisfactory.\nThe general budget undoubtedly should be modified by\nyour thinking. It represents my best ideas, and I believe\nI could administer it. (Don't get me wrong. I'm not\nasking for a job).\nThat's the story to date. The next move is up to you.\nWill you please read this material carefully, comment\non It critically, and reply quickly. Please let me have\nyour reply by September 12*\nJim Miles\nManager\nkadi© Station WBAA\nJMssp"
