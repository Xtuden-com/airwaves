Y.\nDear M. 3* 8\nIn connection with the show WS HUMAN BEINGS,\nI believe this concerns an arrangement Siegel has worked\nout with Wheatley and his working out with some others\nwhereby he is acting as a clearing house for distributing\npaid programs. I know .‘/heatley has furnished him several\nfrom the Lowell Institute. I have not yet received full\ndetail on this myself, but Siegel and I talked it over one\ntime and I suggested he simply go ahead and get the thing\nrolling. Why not give him a ring and ask him to send the\nstuff over — that is, such printed material and descriptions\nas he now has? Or put your guy in touch with him. I think\nhe has the matter in hand.\nSincerely,\nRichard 3. Hull\nRadio - TV Director\nRBIl/var"
