More than\nthirty independent, non-commer¬\ncial stations are participating.\nThe network is sponsored by the\nNational Association of Educa¬\ntional Broadcasters and is de¬\nsigned, according to Mr. Siegel,\nto bring adult, literate, mature\nprograms to an estimated audi¬\nence of 4,000,000.\nPrograms have originated in\nNew York, Harvard University at\nCambridge. Mass., Washington,\nand in London through the co¬\noperation of the British Broad¬\ncasting Corporation. Stations re¬\nceiving them are in twenty states\nthroughout the country. Most of\nthem are college and university\nstations.\nFacilities of WNYC are used to\nprepare the tape recordings: ship¬\nping by mail to the various sta¬\ntions is done by the WNYC staff\nand a WNYC staff member, Mrs.\nTerry Linder, has been placed in\ncharge of co-ordinating the pro¬\ngram schedules.\nThe tapes are circulated on a\nround-robin schedule. The first\nstation mails the tape on to the\nnext and so on until, all stations\nhave received and broadcast thei\ntape. Then it is returned to\nWNYC.\nPrograms have included a series\non health and development prob¬\nlems of human beings prepared by\nthe Lowell Institute Co-operative\nBroadcasting Council at Harvard:\nthe ‘Great Themes in the Great\nHall” series of lectures at Cooper\nUnion; the \"Freedom Sings” series\nof Sesquiccntenniel Concerts from\nWashington by the United States\nArmy Band: a series of \"Music for\nthe Connoisseur” programs from\nWNYC and dramatic productions\nfrom the British Broadcasting\nCorporation."
