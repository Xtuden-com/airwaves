Siegel\nDirector\nRadio Station WtC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nMunicipal Building\nSew York 7, Mew York\nDear Sy«\nThanks for your August 31 letter and your reaction to\nthe network situation. The Yfaldo and Mills r letters were\nself-explanatory * I was at a loss to understand the degree of\noutrage they seemed to indicate* I think you might—if you\nhave not already done so—get some sort of an opinion from\nour little committee and let them enter into argument with\nbrethren-in-the-bond Waldo and Allen*\nX am glad to be reassured about your status, and I\nhope it lasts longer than the end of the year* I know you\nhave a headache which is not possible to describe in two\npages or even a hundred in connection with the CED* It is\nstrictly none of ray business, but I have speculated that\nby any chance, you would be taking a trip to Mexico.\nThree huzzas for the appropriation asking of $2ii9*000\nfor WNYC* I think you stand the best chance of any of us in\nbusting that in this period o war crisis* I am beginning to\nwonder just when the explicable conversation of the Commission\nwill clarify itself with respect, to Clear Channel generally*\nBy all means, keep me informed on this UN pressuring\nof the FGC for a City T? channel* I think that would be\nremarkable. If such is the case, I hope plans for kinescope\nare incorporated—my motives here are selfish*\nI am looking forward to further word on the Academy\nof Medicine proposal* Griffith thinks this sounds very good.\nLast, bdt not least, my resounding congratulations\non another beautiful annual report. I don’t know of anyone\nwho can even come close to you on this proposition*\nSincerely,\nRBHieh\nRkchard B* Hull\nPresident"
