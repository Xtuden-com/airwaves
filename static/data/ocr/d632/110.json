Before I leave, X am dictating this memo-*\nrandom for the NAEB files.\nThis represents the main points of what I said to the executive\nsession at Lexington. What I said there, we still stand behind*\nI said!\n1. We at Illinois believe in the NAEB network, want to see it de¬\nveloped, and want to help in that development regardless of where the net¬\nwork is centered.\n2. In case you are called into service, or an equal emergency\noocurs at WHIG, we are willing to take over and operate the network as it is\nnsw operated, on an emergency basis, pending permanent location and proper\nfinancing.\n3. However, our real interest in housing this network is in the\nprospect of being able to build around it a program of activities, services,\nand research which will improve the efficiency and quality of the network\nand react to the benefit of all the educational stations.\nho If NAEB elects to center the network at Illinois, we shall proceed\nat once with activities, already begun on a conditional basis, to raise funds\nfor such a program as mentioned in (3).\nPreliminary conversations with Foundation representatives lead\nus to believe that there is a good possibility of being able to finance the\nfollowing programs\na) Purchase of equipment for multiple tape duplication, making\npossible simultaneous rebroadcast, when desirable, in all\nparts of the country*\nb) Funds to operate this tape exchange, providing that the\nmember stations arc willing to take over this basic\noperating cost on a gradual plan over a five-year period*\nc) A continuing series of Allerton seminars.\nd) A series of fellowships, varying in length from a few months\nto a year, for the personnel of educational stations*"
