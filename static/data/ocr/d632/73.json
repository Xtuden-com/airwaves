I am delighted to know that\nyou are back home again after what appears to be an extremely\ninteresting junket around the continent. I concur with you wholeÂ¬\nheartedly on not upsetting the network applecart until Illinois is\nprepared and ready to take over. I hope, however, that this can be\ndone as soon as possible after Lexington.\nI presume you have read copies of my letter to Waldo and\nto Allen Miller. I believe these are self-explanatory, but just\nas I indicated to you at Allerton, Hell hath no fury like a program\ndirector spurn<W.I had anticipated a reaction, but nothing quite as\nviscious. 1*11 be happy when you have a program committee which would\ntake any individual off the hook.\nAs far as the Navy is concerned, the latest word I have is\nthat they will be requiring a thousand supply officers within the\nnext ninety days, but that more than six hundred have already\nvolunteered. They are also looking for younger officers, i.e. below\nthe rank of Lieutenant Commander. Although no one knows where the\nlightening will strike next, I hope that 1*11 be clear at least\nuntil the end of the year.\nThe Civil Defense communications problem is beginning to get\nme down, what with the various conflicts going on among different\nlevels of government. Furthermore, we will be getting a new\nadministration in here in September, and possible again in November.\nI have no reason to believe that this will affect the present mode\nof operation of the station.\nWe expect to apply for two hours of additional operating\ntime, and I hope we can break the Commission down. We*ve asked\nThe Voice Of The City"
