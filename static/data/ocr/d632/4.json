This thing has taken tremendous\nresources in personnel and in money. I have virtually exÂ¬\nhausted our telegram code in the current budget, just trying\nto get some of our brethren to give us a fast and firm answer.\nMrs. Linder has been devoting almost all of her time trying\nto keep this Network functioning.\nAny arrangements we have made thus far have been for strictly\nnon-commercial purposes. While I appreciate your interest in\nlabor stations, so far as I know, such stations are selling\ntime, and the arrangements we have made thus far would hot be\napplicable. Obviously, such stations could apply direct to\nthe originators of these programs for permission to use them.\nUnfortunately, I do not have sufficient resources here to do\nthe joh.\nI hope you understand my positio;\nsns :L\nThe Voice Of The City"
