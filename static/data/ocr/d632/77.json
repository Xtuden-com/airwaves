Siegel, Directo\nMunicipal Broadcasting By\nMunicipal Building\nNew York 7» New Yo,\nMy dear Seymour:\nI was very much diskpjSplnted and surprised by your letter of\nAugust eighteenth in which you say that you do not feel\njustified in recommending TREASURES OFF THE SHELF to the\nNAEB Network inasmuch as it is not carried on WNYC. That\nseems to be a very biased and narrow method of determining\nwhat programs would be interesting and of value to the\nNAEB. It seems to me that if a program in the estimation of\nNAEB Director of the Tape Network has value, it should be\nmade available to the network, regardless of whether one of\nthe outlets of that network failed to see its value. I put\nit in the same category as my decision not to use your medical\nseries. Just because WUOM does not carry it is no reason\nfor not making it available to the other network outlets.\nI understand your reluctance to write to me, and there is\nnothing personal in my comments—no criticism of you. I\nhope you understand. But it does seem to me that the method\nof determining tapes to be made available veers towards\ncreating a /NYC Network rather than an NAEB Network.\nI am not greatly concerned about your unwillingness to make\nthe series available to the NAEB inasmuch as a lnrge pro¬\nportion of the stations have requested the t apes. We had\ninformed them originally that they would be available through\nthe NAEB Tape Network, but now we shall Inform those stations\nof your decision and make the tapes available direct from\nWUOM.\nI am coming down to the Army game on October fourteenth. I\nhave reservations at the Algonquin—I hope. I look forward\nto seeing you at that time. This g ame comes before the\nLexington meeting.\nCordially yours.\nWaldo Abbot\nDirector of Broadcasting"
