To\nDear Mr. GruberÂ«\nWith respect to your April 25th note regarding the question\nof WE HUMAN BEINGS, I wrote you in answer to a memorandum and enclosure\nyou sent April 3rd. This memorandum cams from WDET-FM in Detroit.\nApparently this Is Horry*s labor station. This felloe was asking about\nthis show and as a result I wrote to Merry and to Cy Siegel, telling\nthem of this request and interest in the show. Cy says the show is a\ntape show from the Lowell Institute in Boston, produced by Parker Wheatley,\nbut that It is not available on a free basis because of the cost of\ntape and duplication. If there is any further interest on the part\nof Detroit, they should work it out with Morry through Cy for some\nkind of a pay arrangement. This was one of the shows that Siegel\nis releasing over the NAEB tape network.\nSincerely,\nRBH/var\nRichard B. Hull\nRadio - TV Director"
