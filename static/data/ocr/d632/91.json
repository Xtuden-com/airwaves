Siegel \"k\nRadio Station WNYC\nMunicipal Building\nNew York 7> New York\nDear Si:\nThe series by Dr* Dora Wagner has been made\nuntimely by the Korean situation. The tension in Germany\nlast spring and during part of the summer made Dr. Wagner*s\nprograms of natural interest then—but not naturally now.\nThe spotlight may swing toward Berlin again soon, in which\nevent the series would again be timely.\nOur experience points up the dangers inherent\nin delays in network bookings, particularly if bicycling is\nused. And of course, also the effect of sudden changes in\nnews emphasis on g eographical areas. Dr. Wagner’s series was\nnot a commentary, however, in my meaning of the word. It if\nwas, so too, are the ’’Great Themes”, ”A Long Life”, and others,\nand if the area of historical background and even direct\ncommentary are excluded, how can the Round Table be circulated?\nThis is not intended as a challenge of your\njudgement on appropriateness of the series as much as it is to\nrejection of the programs as commentaries. Also I do not see\ncirculation of commentaries as a radical departure in NAEB\npractice.\nBelieve me I understand the headaches at your\nend and I»m definitely sympathetic with them. My concern is\nthat Dr. Wagner was informed the series would be offered after\nI received word to that effect from Mrs. Linder. Even then\nwe were worried that the offer would not be made until Sept¬\nember for reasons not immediately evident.\nAlso believe me when I assure you that I am not\nas irate as this may appear at first sight, but that I am,\nCordially yours,\nAM: cm\nAllen Miller\nStation Manager"
