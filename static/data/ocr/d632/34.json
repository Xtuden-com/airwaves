I am writing to him suggesting\nthat he make available a single copy of any special\nprogram that might be available for distribution to\nthe NA3SB network. The Amsterdam Symphony sounds like\na terrific idea, but I have certain qualms in connection\nwith Mr. Petrillofs point of view on the importation of\nforeign music. However, we got a clearance on the Canadian\nConcerts, so it is entirely possible that we might be able\nto do the same thing with the Netherland situation.\n1 am dropping Ted Cott a reminder concerning BPM*\nI do not know whether or not he is still in the publishing\nbusiness.\nWith all\nSNSs cb\nThe Voice Of The City"
