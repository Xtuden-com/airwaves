  "text": "In accordance with our telephone conversation, I am\nenclosing, herewith, a map of the present stations of\nthe National Association of Educational Broadcasters\nTranscription Network.\nSome Â©f these stations are FM and some are AM. They\nare all non-commercial.\nI am not in a position to speak for either the Academy\noft the stations. It would seem to me, however, that\nif you were prepared to underwrite the annual cost to\nthe Academy of twenty-five thousand (25,000) dollars,\nyou should make that proposal direct to Dr. Iago Galdston.\nAny arrangement concerning a quid pro quo for Smith,\nKline and French would necessarily have to be made by\nthe Academy.\nInsofar as the stations are concerned, because they are\nnon-commercial, there can be no mention of Smith, Kline\nand ffench on the air, except as identifying the President\nof Smith, Kline and French in any remarks at the opening\nof the aeries.\nA grant of one thousand (1,000) dollars per station per\nyear, which would involve a weekly broadcast for fifty-\ntwo (52) weeks (if that quantity of material were made\navailable by the Academy) would necessarily have to be\naccepted by the individual member stations of NAEB. Any\nconditions concerning such broadcasts would also have\nto be accepted by the individual stations of NAEB."
