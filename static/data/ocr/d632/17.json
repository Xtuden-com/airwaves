At the moment it seems to me that\nan adaptation of the Ohio State judging forms would be good. We substituted a\nmore suitable heading, took out references to ’‘accompanying materials,” and added\na fifth point — ’’Technical Quality.” I am enclosing a couple of samples of our\nproposal, and have sent some to Seymour Siegel. In addition to such systematic\ncomments, I should hope that you would make freer comments in a letter.\nAll of us here consider the Network not only most important in itself, but also a\nlaboratory of great importance for testing our efforts against your standards,\nboth as to program and technical quality.\nIt will be good to hear from you, and I’ll see you in Cj\ncmh\nEnclosures"
