  "text": "One of the inescapable conclusions of the Allerton House\nConference of 1949, was the necessity for an exchange of program\nresource among non-commercial educational/ stations. While the\nofficers of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters\nwere making representations to various Foundations for sufficient\nfunds to establish a network or a transcription exchange, Mr.\nRichard Hull, the President of NAEB agreed with my suggestion to\nget a tape exchange started as soon as possible within the framework\nof whatever resource was now and at present available to the educational\nstations.\nAccordingly, in the latter part of February 1950, an official\noffering of a series of programs produced by Parker Wheatley of the\nLowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council was offered to a\nhalf dozen member stations of NAEB. \"We Human Beings\" was the title\nof the first group offered. The second group was \"A Long Life\".\nThe latter included talks on cancer, arthritis, accidents, alcoholism\nand other medical topics.\nWith funds provided by the trustees of Cooper Union, a third\nseries was recorded, marking the 90th Anniversary of that institution.\nEntitled \"Great Themes from the Great Hall\", speakers included\nRalph Bunche of the United Nations; Walter White of the NAACP; and\nCarlos Romulo of the United Nations."
