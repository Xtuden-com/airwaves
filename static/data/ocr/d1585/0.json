We are\nsending you the September 28, 1933 issue of Education by Radio\nin which this was the leading article.\n2. Supplementary report by our Counsel concerning his activities\nbefore and during the Conference. (A mimeographed report.)\n3. \"Financial Aspects of Radio Broadcasting\", a mimeographed\nreport compiled from information published both in Education by\nRadio and in the Congressional Record and filed with the Federal\nRadio Commission and other Governmental agencies in 1932. This\nreport was distributed on July 27th to the Governmental delegaÂ¬\ntions in Mexico City whose members had not had an opportunity\nto see it in 1932.\nThe National Committee on Education by Radio, in accordance with its desire\nto increase educational broadcasting and raise radio standards generally, is\nglad to make those reports available to you. Your comments will be appreciated.\nCordially ycipE^,>-x\nTracy //Secretary\nand Research director.\nTFT:RR\nRADIO IS AN EXTENSION OF THE HOME"
