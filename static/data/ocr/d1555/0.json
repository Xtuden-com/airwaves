C.\nAn Ideal System of\nBroadcasting for America\nA plan for a supplemental system\nof broadcasting stations was proposed\nformally to the Federal Communica¬\ntions Commission at Washington, D.\nC., on May 16 by the National Com¬\nmittee on Education by Radio. The\nNational Committee on Education by\nRadio is an organization formed more\nthan four years ago at the suggestion\nof the United States Commissioner of\nEducation and consists of representa¬\ntives from nine great national educa¬\ntional associations, including state\nuniversities, land-grant colleges, Cath¬\nolic educational societies, educational\nbroadcasters, adult education groups,\nthe National Education Association,\nand the American Council on Educa¬\ntion.\nThe plan proposes a government\nnetwork supplementing but not sup¬\nplanting or unduly interfering with\nthe present system. Affiliated with\nthis government network would be lo¬\ncal, state, and institutional radio sta¬\ntions that are engaged in broadcasts\nof public welfare nature.\nAmerica is the only important na¬\ntion that has permitted radio broad¬\ncasting to be practically monopolized\nby commercial groups. The plan pro¬\nposed will conserve the advantages of\nthe prevailing world type of govern¬\nmental control and the present private\nsystem now in operation in America.\nThe combination will give America an\nideal system. A system of local sta¬\ntions, a government network, and pri¬\nvate commercial networks in combina¬\ntion will give the nation the advan¬\ntages of each system of broadcasting.\nThe inherent limitations of one system\nwill be offset by counteracting advan¬\ntages of the other. -Such- a system\nwould make available to American lis¬\nteners a great variety of programs,\ngiving each listener the opportunity\nof enjoying the best talent that Amer¬\nica produces.\nListener’s Choice\nHave you ever turned your radio\ndial from, one end to the other without\nfinding a program that interested you\nbecause the same program was being\nrepeated on all the stations within\nyour reach? If this has been your\nexperience, you will be interested in\na plan which has been recently pro¬\nposed to the Federal Communications\nCommission in Washington which\npromises to extend the type of variety\nof programs available to each Amer¬\nican listener.\nThis plan, which is proposed by the\nNational Committee on Education by\nRadio, recommends the establishment\nof a broadcasting system to supple¬\nment but not to supplant the present\nprivate system. This public system\nwould give greater freedom of choice\nto the listener, who, under all systems,\nfinally pays the bills. By a turn of\nthe dial the listener could enjoy either\na constructive public program or the\nalluring charms of rejuvenating crys¬\ntals, the merits of toothpastes and\nmouthwashes, or the latest scheme\nfor selling something.\nThe national government network\nwould present programs in the public\ninterest, free from advertising. Pro¬\ngrams of entertainment and informa¬\ntion by the best talent procurable\nthrough a national network would be\navailable for all radio listeners. The\ngovernment network, free from all the\nlimitations of a system dependent up¬\non advertising, could select for its\nprograms any talent available in\nAmerica and thus give American au¬\ndiences the nation’s best in entertain¬\nment and information.\nThe National Committee on Educa¬\ntion by Radio, author of the plan, is\nan organization formed more than\nfour years ago at the suggestion of\nthe United States Commissioner of\nEducation and consists of representa¬\ntives from nine great national educa¬\ntional associations, including state\nuniversities, land-grant colleges,\nCatholic educational societies, educa¬\ntional broadcasters, adult education\ngroups, the National Education Asso¬\nciation, and the American Council on\nEducation.\nAll Radio Educates\nOnly recently has the public gener¬\nally understood the tremendous influ¬\nence of radio broadcasting regardless\nof who sends it out. As listeners real¬\nize that every program exerts its\ngood, bad, or indifferent effect (edu¬\ncates, shall we say?), it becomes in¬\ncreasingly apparent that the public\nhas the most at stake in radio.\nThe establishment of a supple¬\nmental system of public broadcasting\nstations is being hailed as a recogni¬\ntion that an unpolluted source of in¬\nformation, education, culture, and\nwholesome entertainment is essential\nto the success of democratic govern¬\nment.\nNOTE TO EDITORS\nThe material on this page is sub¬\nmitted to you for use at your con¬\nvenience.

These stations were\nnoncommercial in character and as\nsuch soon found themselves in severe\ncompetition with commercial stations\npossessing the advantages and priv¬\nileges of national hookups. These\nsmaller, local, nonprofit stations, es¬\ntablished to promote public welfare,\nwere steadily reduced in their radio\nprivileges from a paltry 6 per cent in\n1931 until today they represent less\nthan 2 per cent of the total available\nfacilities. Ten state universities still\nown and operate their broadcasting\nstations. Land-grant colleges and\nprivate institutions operate an addi¬\ntional twenty-four stations. The for¬\nmation of such local stations would be\nstimulated under a plan proposed re¬\ncently to the Federal Communications\nCommission at Washington.\nThe plan proposes a third great\nbroadcasting chain to be operated by\nthe Federal government and offering\naffiliation to all nonprofit stations\noperating solely in the public interest.\nThe government chain will afford each\nof these local stations the opportunity\n-tu enrich their'prugrams-througlrna^\ntional hookups. These stations, like\nthose owned by the states of Wiscon¬\nsin, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, Kansas,\nOklahoma, and others, will be able to\ngive such service to the people in their\nstates as well as bring to them the\ntalent of America on the national\nhookups. Such state stations have\nproven their value and acceptability\nthrough their public forums, like the\none in Wisconsin where free time is\ngiven for all legislators, for public of¬\nficials, and for all political parties.\nAlso they have demonstrated their\nworth by presenting programs of gen¬\neral interest, as well as special pro¬\ngrams to the schools. For purposes\nof public business, for health pro¬\ngrams, for adult education, for items\nof local interest, such stations will be\navailable.\nThe plan was presented formally to\nthe Federal Communications Commis¬\nsion at Washington in response to a\nrequest of the Commission for plans\nfor the improvement of America’s\nbroadcasting system. Proposed on\nbehalf of education by the National\nCommittee on Education by Radio,\nits advantages were seen alike by cul¬\ntural and civic leaders.\nThe National Committee on Educa¬\ntion by Radio, the organization behind\nthe proposal, is a well-known organi¬\nzation acting in radio matters on be¬\nhalf of nine important national edu¬\ncational associations. These nine as¬\nsociations represent both public and\nprivate, formal and adult, technical\nand professional, school and higher,\nstate-supported and Federally-aided\neducation. They are: American Coun¬\ncil on Education, Association of Land-\nGrant Colleges and Universities, The\nJesuit Educational Association, Na¬\ntional Association of Educational\nBroadcasters, National Association of\nState Universities, National Catholic\nEducational Association, National\nCouncil of State Superintendents, Na¬\ntional Education Association, and Na¬\ntional University Extension Associa¬\ntion.\nShare the Air\nWhy did the American people per¬\nmit an instrument so vital to popular\ngovernment as instantaneous and uni¬\nversal communication to be seized and\ndevoted exclusively to selling goods,\nmaking all other uses subordinate\nand incidental?\nIn spite of America’s boasted ag¬\ngressiveness in business fields, as a\nnation she has been exceedingly slow\nin realizing and envisioning values in\nthe realm of social welfare. During\nthe early years of radio development\neveryone’s attention was centered on\nmaterial progress. The noise of the\ndollars jingling by drowned the few\nfeeble voices proclaiming in the wil¬\nderness the public welfare values of\nan intimate talk to every one of the\nnation’s firesides. America was pre¬\noccupied, ignorant, and neglectful of\nintangible social services. It has re¬\nquired the chastening of calamity to\nforce America to study social science.\nWhat is needed today is a plan\nwhich gives promise of conserving for\npublic purposes a share in the air.\nThe present American system of\nbroadcasting is an almost incredible\nabsurdity. Our country stakes its\nexistence upon universal suffrage, up¬\non the general intelligence of its citi¬\nzens, upon the spread of reliable in¬\nformation, upon the attitudes and\njudgments of all the people; and then\nconsigns exclusively to private inter¬\nests this means of universal communi¬\ncation. As a result, its use for gen¬\neral public welfare becomes inevitably\nsubordinate and incidental.\nThe plan proposed by the National\nCommittee on Education by Radio.\nasks only for a portion of radio chan¬\nnels, leaving the major part of the\nlimited available band for the use of\nprivate commercial interests. It does\nnot ask for a definite percentage of\nthe available radio frequencies. The\namount required must be determined\nby technical experts and will change\nas modern developments take place\nin this comparatively new art. How¬\never, is it unreasonable for the public\nto reserve even as much as one-fourth\nof the facilities of the air for public\nuse if merchandizing still retains\nthree-fourths ?\nThe National Committee on Educa¬\ntion by Radio, author of the plan, con¬\nsists of representatives from nine\ngreat national educational associa¬\ntions, including state universities,\nland-grant colleges, Catholic educa¬\ntional societies, educational broadcast¬\ners, adult education groups, the Na¬\ntional Education Association, and the\nAmerican Council on Education.\nCommunications\nCommission Studies\nEducational Broadcasting\nThe Federal Communications Com¬\nmission has recently completed a hear¬\ning at Washington to which were in¬\nvited persons interested in educational\nbroadcasting to present plans and rec¬\nommendations for making available\nfor purposes of culture and education,\nthis new instrument of mass commun¬\nication, the radio. Their interest was\nfurther evidenced by the announce¬\nment at the conclusion of the confer¬\nence that a committee was being\nformed to study the various proposals\nand to arrive at the best possible solu¬\ntion to the complicated problems in¬\nvolved. The Commission designated\nas the committee’s head the United\nStates Commissioner of Education,\nDr. John W. Studebaker. Other ap¬\npointments will be announced from\ntime to time by the Commission.\nCommittee Represents American Education\nThe National Committee on Education by Radio is an organization\nrepresenting nine important national educational associations. The\nCommittee can, and, in reality, does represent education in America\nas can be seen from the following list of its members and the organi¬\nzations with which they are associated:\nArthur G. Crane, president, University of Wyoming, Laramie,\nWyoming, National Association of State Universities.\nJames E. Cummings, 1312 Massachusetts Avenue, N. W., Wash¬\nington, D. C., National Catholic Educational Association.\nW. I. Griffith, director, Radio Station WOI, Iowa State College of\nAgriculture and Mechanic Arts, Ames, Iowa, National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters.\nJ. 0. Keller, assistant to the president, Pennsylvania State College,\nState College, Pennsylvania, National University Extension Asso¬\nciation.\nJoy Elmer Morgan, 1201 Sixteenth Street, N. W., Washington,\nD. C., National Education Association.\nCharles A. Robinson, S. J., Saint Louis University, Saint Louis,\nMissouri, The Jesuit Educational Association.\nJames N. Rule, state superintendent of public instruction, Harris¬\nburg, Pennsylvania, National Council of State Superintendents.\nH. J. Umberger, Kansas State College of Agriculture, Manhattan,\nKansas, Association of Land-Grant Colleges and Universities.\nGeorge F. Zook, president, American Council on Education, 744\nJackson Place, Washington, D. C., American Council on Education.\nRadio and Freedom\nof Speech\nToday, through radio, a man may\nspeak to an entire nation. The power\nof the spoken word is enhanced be¬\nyond the wildest dreams of ancient\norators. What a thrill it would have\nbeen to have listened to the Philippics\nof Demosthenes and Cicero or to the\noratorical masterpieces of Patrick\nHenry and Daniel Webster! Today it\nis possible for Americans to listen to\ntheir President as he speaks to them\nin their millions of homes from the\nquiet and seclusion of his office.\nAmerican institutions are dependent\nupon each man’s freedom of thought\nand speech.\nOf all principles safeguarding\nAmerican institutions, the one afford¬\ning the greatest protection is freedom\nof speech. Without it, freedom of\nthought is nullified. Freedom of\nspeech includes freedom of the press\nas well as freedom in all means of\ncommunication. America has zeal¬\nously defended freedom of the press,\neven to the point of permitting ex¬\ncesses and abuses rather than haz¬\narding the dangers of the slightest\ncensorship. America has recognized\nthe same principle in maintaining the\nright of communication free and un¬\ntrammeled for all citizens using the\nUnited States mails. Postal facilities\nhave been extended to every citizen,\nto the remotest hamlet, to the rural\npopulation—even at the expense of\nannual deficits—in order to protect\nthe right of universal communication.\nTelephone and telegraph have been\nmade public utilities and common car¬\nriers of communication. Their serv-\n-iee is open- tg all citizens who are able\nand ready to pay for it. The right of\nuncensored communication is the es¬\nsential expression of free speech.\nWithout free speech and free discus¬\nsion a government of the people can¬\nnot endure. It is the bed-rock of\nAmerican institutions.\nRadio broadcasting is the most po¬\ntent of all forms of communication.\nIt is instantaneous and universal. It\nspeaks to literate and illiterate alike.\nIt calls a nation on instant notice into\na great public town meeting. If free¬\ndom of the press and of the post office,\nof telephone and telegraph, are essen¬\ntial to freedom of speech, how many\ntimes more vital is radio ? Public use\nof this communication marvel of the\ncentury must be preserved to insure\nAmerica’s freedom of speech. It must\nnot be permitted to come under the\ncontrol of any limited body of men or\nspecial interests. It must remain un¬\nder public control for public welfare.\nIt is not a question of the character of\nthe private control, however honor¬\nable and decent. America cannot\nsafely entrust the means of universal\ncommunication exclusively to any pri¬\nvate control, since such control must\nbe governed by the limitations of\navailable time and channels and by\nthe necessity for producing an ade¬\nquate or even an excessive income.\nSafeguarding American\nBroadcasting\nThere are over seventeen million ra¬\ndio receiving sets in American homes.\nMany of them are in use many hours\neach day. Recent surveys show that\nschool children listen an average of\ntwo and one-half hours per day to ra¬\ndio broadcasts. For the welfare of\nAmerican citizens, young and old, this\nbroadcasting flood, influencing Amer¬\nican thought and attitude, must not\nbe permitted to come under the con¬\ntrol of any groups who might use it\nfor propaganda or other selfish pur¬\nposes.\nA plan has recently been proposed\nto the Federal Communications Com¬\nmission at Washington which prom¬\nises to protect American listeners\nfrom the dangers of propaganda. This\nplan, advanced by the National Com¬\nmittee on Education by Radio, pro¬\nposes an independent broadcasting\nnetwork presenting programs side by\nside with the present programs, but\noperated and controled by the people\nthemselves. The programs presented\non the public network will be chosen\nfor their public welfare values.\nThe public system would permit\nbroadcasts to the public schools by\nmaster teachers, bringing stimulation\nto teachers and pupils alike, and con¬\nnecting even the most isolated class¬\nroom with the best in music, litera¬\nture, information, and entertainment.\nState stations have already demon¬\nstrated that broadcasting improves\nschool instruction. Even if general\nbroadcasts to public schools should in¬\ncrease the effectiveness of school ex¬\npenditures a mere five per cent, it\nwould return additional values worth\none hundred fifty millions annually\non the three billion dollar education\nbill. Private as well as public schools\nare equally concerned in broadcasting\nvalues. In neither public nor private\nschools is advertising, even the unob¬\njectionable, likely to be permitted."
