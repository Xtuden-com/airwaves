Take Technocracy for example. Thru the organization\nof listeners into discussion groups, it is possible to encourage interest in certain\nsubjects and to make the broadcast programs more vital. In addition, these listener\norganizations can be of immense value in reporting to the broadcaster the results of\nthe broadcast,\nI have tried to indicate not only some of the problems which educational\nbroadcasting faces, but to point out a few avenues to the solution of these problems.\nThe time for action is certainly at hand, and one of the first accomplishments should\nbe the unified program listing, lest those educational.broadcasts of value, which\nwe may now hear, slip away unnoticed."
