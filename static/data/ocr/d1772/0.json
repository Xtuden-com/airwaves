Bidlack\nOn May 28th, the Federal Communciations Com¬\nmission extended the date for compliance with para¬\ngraphs 3.690 and 3.691 of Part 3 of its rules govern¬\ning Radio Broadcast Services. This extended date is\nJune 1, 1959. These are the paragraphs which re¬\nquire television transmitters to have frequency and\nmodulation monitors. In its release, the Commission\nstated that with the continued development of more\nstable frequency control circuits in all types of broad¬\ncast transmitters (AM, FM, and TV) it is consider¬\ning a review of its requirements on the continued use\nof such apparatus. Should it appear that the rules\nrelating to such monitors need to be amended, an ap¬\nNAEB Engineering Newsletter\nSeptember, 1958\nNAEB Engineering Newsletter, a quarterly publication issued\nby the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, 14\nGregory Hall, Urbana, III. $2 a year, edited by Cecil S. Bid-\nlack.\npropriate rulemaking proceeding will be initiated.\nOn June 9th the Commission also adopted an\namendment to its rules for non-commercial educa¬\ntional FM stations regarding its CONELRAD rules\nconcerning these stations. Section 3.573 (b) has now\nbeen amended to refer educational stations to the ap¬\npropriate section 3.1003 (a) of CONELRAD rules\nrather than to the commercial FM remote control\nrules as formerly.\n*****\nOur picture for this month illustrates a “boor-\nmobile” developed by John Boor of KCTS in Seattle,\nWash., for use in schools in their area. The antenna\nis readily demountable and is at a height of approxi¬\nmately 6Y2 feet so that persons of ordinary height do\nnot bump their heads on it. The five-element Yagi\nantenna for channel 9 is of commercial make as well\nas the cart, so that total cost of cart and antenna is\naround $25.00.\nIn addition to the picture Boor has supplied us\nwith a list of what he considers highly desirable fea¬\ntures for a TV receiver to be used in a classroom:\n1) Flat tinted glass, tilted forward over the pic¬\nture tube.\n2) Four-inch beveled light shield around the pic¬\nture tube.\n3) Front speaker, eight-inch minimum.\n4) Long heavy AC cord.\n5) Cart with large rollers.\n6) Yagi type demountable antenna on 6^-foot\nmast.\n1"
