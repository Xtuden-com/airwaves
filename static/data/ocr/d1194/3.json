  "text": "ED ADAMS\nOne of our good friends and colleagues has gone from us and, because he so\nbrightened the world with his presence, his departure leaves dark and lonely\nplaces.\nI first met Ed as a fellow member of the NAEB Board of 1955; I saw him last\nwhen he came to Washington last summer to visit his son and daughter and see\nhis new grandchild. He knew then what was ahead and, though the progress of\ndisease had weakened and frailed the body, there was still the twinkle in his\neyes and the unfailing pleasure in sharing his fund of amusing stories with others.\nEd had a zest for life, which, coupled with warmth, wit and a lively sense of\nhumor, made him friends wherever he went.\nWith all the legitimate demands on his time and energies as a teacher and\nadministrator, he still gave generously of himself in support of a great variety\nof activities and interests. As a banquet speaker, school assembly performer,\nradio and TV broadcaster, NAEB director, and civic worker, he contributed\nabundantly to the enrichment of his community and of his profession. His life\nwas filled with deep devotion to his family and to his colleagues, to education\nand to educational broadcasting; blessed with imagination, creativity, sympathy\nand good humor, it was undergirded by a courage that never faltered.\nWe shall miss him in our councils and fellowship; we will long remember this\nwarm gently person and good friend.\n-WGH"
