It is important to\nbring in associations rather than individuals.\nSkomia - The focus of this problem is t!iThe best use of the best tools regardless\nof who controls them.\"\n(Note after the committee meeting by Skornia - It should be pointed out that none of\nthe above rather lengthy consideration of these two important problems resulted in\nany specific recommendations with possible exception of inclusion in a fCThird Allerton.\")\nScholarships\nGarrison - Asked whether the term \"scholarships\" was interpreted to include money\nfor travel to certain places. Felt that there was need for some method of providing\nfunds to allow for specific study at a chosen location. Consensus of the committee\nwas that this type of scholarship should be included.\nSkornia - Better to call this type of grant a Special Study Grant and include it\nas a fourth area of professional advancement to be considered - seminars, workshops,\nscholarships, special study grants.\nWorkshops\nWynn - called attention to the recommendations by Winnie, Bretz, Stasheff and\nSkornia as to the course future workshops might take, with possible consideration of\na combined workshop for production, graphics, lighting, etc., personnel in which the\nfirst part of the workshop would be spent in group study of special problems and latter\npart of workshop a joint endeavor involving all aspects.\nWinnie - There was an immediate servicing need in educational TV which has largely\nbeen served by the three Production workshops. This need can probably now better be\nserved by the stations. We have now reached a point where we need to consider improveÂ¬\nment of specific skills, and possibly development of the \"leader\" group."
