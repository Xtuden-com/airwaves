  "text": "Mr. James S. Miles, WBAA, suggests that NAEB should consider a change in the\nvice-presidency for the Association, in order to give Board representa¬\ntion to the varied interests within the Association. In brief, he suggests\nselection of a vice president to represent each of the following three\ngroups, namely (a) college or community station, (b) the school stations,\nand (c) the individual members.\nSuch a proposal., obviously, would call for an amendment of the constitu¬\ntion and by-laws, but the Board might reconrmend such a change to the mem¬\nbership P Such a change would increase the number of vice presidents from\none to threeo It would also increase the Board membership by two, assum¬\ning that each vice president would have the status of the present vice\npresident. It would always provide a representation on the Board for the\nvarious special points of view, without creating a special type of director\nper se o\n1^16-56"
