Wynn - Should we recommend that someone be given the responsibility of\nlooking into this problem, including the area of editing research materials,\nfurther and making a recommendation to the committee?\nHead - He* s a little mystified about the emphasis on research in the discussion\nof publications. In a national organization such as this the balance of research\ncovered in a publication should reflect the percentage of research that educational\nbroadcasters are involved in. Garrison agreed.\nWynn â€” Could Headquarters staff explore this matter further and make any necessary\nrecommendations to the committee for consideration for inclusion in requests for\nfunds? Skomia - What staff says doesn11 carry as much weight as what members of\ncommittee say. No further discussion or action taken.\nMeeting adjourned.\nHEHsjy\nHABIB HEiiDQDAREERS\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbans, Illinois"
