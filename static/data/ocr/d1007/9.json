Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Bob:\nWe’re rather disposed after considerable thought\non the matter to ask some Foundation for funds to\nsupport research during the next year or two. As\nwe’ve always asked Kellogg its possible interest I’d\nappreciate a preliminary reaction to the tentative\nproposal which I enclose. This is in the nature of\na special project and I’m aware of the general dis¬\nposition of Kellogg to look at more long range pro¬\nposals, but I might be wrong on this particular one.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFES:fmh\nEnel"
