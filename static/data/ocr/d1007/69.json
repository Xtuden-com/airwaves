Before the first Kellogg grant, and before the efforts of\nthe HAEB in this area of professional advancement and educational integra¬\ntion could be brought to bear effectively, stations were often a part of an\nEnglish, Speech, Engineering or Drama Department* Dues therefore generally\nhad to corns out of the budgets of these Departments, rather than being rec¬\nognised as confer able to those of associations involving the entire institi*-\ntion*"
