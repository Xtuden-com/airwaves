The growth of community- as well as institutionally-based stations has also\nprovided a new type of concept of educational broadcasting, as well as new membership\nrepresentation of high caliber, the directors of several of these stations having\nbeen distinguished educators, college and university presidents and individuals of\nlike stature, which speaks well for the increasingly high professional caliber of\nNAEB membership representatives.\nThe caliber of personnel is increasingly being improved also by the\nscholarship, workshop, and other staff upgrading projects which the NAEB operates.\nAlong with the growth of Active membership, there has been an increasing\ngrowth in the number and influence of Associate members-those who broadcast over\ncommercial stations. Another category, Affiliate membership, enables interested inÂ¬\ndividuals or organizations which would not qualify for Active or Associate status to\naffiliate themselves with the NAEB and find an opportunity to support its aims and\nobjectives."
