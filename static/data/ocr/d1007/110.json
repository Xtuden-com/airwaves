The keen enthusiasm expressed\nby member stations has been developed while operating\nunder a system that precludes regular, dependable, and\ntimely service. This will be altered during the summer\nof 1952.\nProgram resources are maturing and developing at\na most encouraging rate. National organizations, governmental\nagencies, foreign governments, international organizations ,\nand private public service groups are now exercising the\ninitiative in providing programs for the network. In\nthe fall of 1952 the network will begin the distribution\nof programs produced under a grant from the Fund For Adult\nEducation. This project was predicated on the existence\nand efficient operation of a tape network service. Plans\nare developing for extensive cooperative program production\nby member stations.\nIn view of all of this, it is impossible to look\nupon the future of the tape network with anything but\nenthusiastic optimism."
