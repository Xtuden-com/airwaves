Hull\nChairman of the Board\nNAEB\nc/o WOSU-TV\n2470 North Starr Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nBear Dicks\nSince I will be in the Schwarzwald or Provence at the\ntime of the March NAEB Board meeting and since I have\nstrong feelings about what Jack White appears to feel\nis a fait accompli (see Inside Channels, Vol. VI, No. 2)\nI have a request to make of you.\nMay Chris Donaldson and Dick Vogl have about 15 minutes\nof the Board's time (in advance of any vote on the\nmatter) to tell the Board why I feel this so-called\n\"plan for sharing Washington responsibilities\" will\nmean the death of the NAEB? Since the Board, within\nmy memory, has frequently permitted other non-members\nto address it (Hill, Hull, Marks, Meaney and Vogl\namong others) I do not anticipate you will have any\ntrouble acceding to this request.\nDirector, Region IV\ncci Mr. Harley\nMr. Donaldson\nMr. Vogl\nP.S. You will perhaps be interested to know that my\nmail in response to ray memo re NABB-NET is rather\npleasant (for me) to read. Not one letter of disagreeÂ¬\nment has yet arrived."
