Hill, Administrative Vice President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n13U6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Harold:\nVery briefly, in answer to your request of March 21, this is\nthe substance of Dr. Schwarzwalderfs position on the subjects\ndiscussed at the Milwaukee Board Meeting as presented by Vogl\nand me:\n1. Legal representation and the Channel 12 situation\nThe NAEB performed very badly in this matter and has\nplaced itself in the ridiculous position of declining\nassistance to an important member organization in a\ndispute in which NAEB should have been a pillar of\nstrength and leadership. The very name of the organ¬\nization clearly states that it is an association of\nEducational Broadcasters. The stated purpose of the\norganization also makes clear its role in such cases.\nThere should not even be a question of what policy to\nfollow. There does, however, seem to be confusion\nover the role of the NAEB Legal Counsel in the matter.\nDespite that firm!s long and loyal tenure, is it not\npossible that its welfare has become confused with\nNAEB*s? Legal Counsel does not make policy nor should\nthe awareness of Legal Counsel*s other interests\naffect NAEB*s policy. NAEB must support its member\norganizations and, where necessary, seek other counsel\nto assist in the implementation of that policy. The\nfact of NAEB’s timorous vacillation in this matter\nwhich offered the perfect opportunity for NETRC to\ndramatically step in on the side of WHYY-TV — thus\nfurther illustrating nAEB*s weakness and indecision —\ncan now only be painfully reassessed with the hope that\nit might awake the organization to sharpen its thinking\nand its action on behalf of all its membership."
