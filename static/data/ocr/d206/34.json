  "text": "(2)\nBoth NAEB and Netrc will expect to furnish to this policy¬\nmaking body such reports and recommendations as are deemed\nappropriate. Once policy has been determined, NAEB and NETRC\nwill endeavor to communicate such policies to their respective\nconstituents—NAEB to individuals in educational broadcasting,\nNETRC to educational stations and agencies.\nSince individuals engaged in or interested in educational broadcasting\nusually are concerned with many of the same matters as are\neducational stations and agencies it is to be expected that NAEB\nand Netrc frequently will find themselves involved in the same\nmatters. The recent establishment in the nations capitol of the\nNAEB headquarters and the new NETRC Washington office not only\nwill furnish the JCEB with the various staff functions required\nbut also will facilitate close cooperation among all three agencies.\nMoreover, it should result in a clarification of separate but\ninter-related roles, less duplication of effort, and more effective\nand extensive service not oiiy to those in educational radio\nand television but also to those in the other areas of educational\nendeavor, to those in government, and to the general public.\nTo clarify further the respective roles of NAEB and NETRC, expecially\nas they now assume cooperatively the staff functions previously\nhandled by the JCET's personnel, the officers of NAEB and\nNETRC are agreed on the following pattern of responsibility as a\nguide for day-to-day working relationships."
