NAEB - JCEB - NETRC Relationships\nBeginning with the poor judgement of meeting with NETRC\nin its own camp, the error has been compounded by even\naccepting seriously the terms offered NAEB* But to\nanalyze briefly: station and network activation should\nnever become Center functions; NAEB should not be con¬\nfined to just “stimulation of greater use of radio and\ntelevision\"; nor should it accede to the Center*s\nintention to control international affairs, etc* NETRC*s\nsuggestion that the NAEB President be a guest at regular\nNETRC Affiliates Meetings is in no way equal to NETRC *s\nsuggested representation at NAEB board meetings and is\nabsolutely, unequivocally unacceptable. Too, NAEB's\nmembership in JCEB whose Washington office is now financed\nby NETRC, places NAEB in the questionable position of\nsubordination to NETRC* The Center's offers are absurdly\ninsufficient and ratification of the terms presented will\nindeed mean the end of NAEB as an effective organization*\nFinally, it should now be evident that NAEB must fight\nfor its very existence*\nlours very sincerely.\nAssistant General Manager\nand Program Director\nCD: ah\ncc: Dr* John C. Schwarzwalder"
