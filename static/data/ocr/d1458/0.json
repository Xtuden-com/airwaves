But you know how it is — things keen cropping\nup here and there, and it winds up that the things you want to^ do\ngo undone* Well, we don't especially care to go through life oeing\ncalled procrastinators. Furthermore, we think we're doing some\nthings back here in our little niche at the rear of the I. U.\nAuditorium that some of you would like to know about. So this\nNEWSLETTER is another excuse for us to talk about ourselves once\nagain.\nUp to our necks in work, as usual* Perhaps you've heard that\neach week-day xve broadcast the INDIANA SCHOOL OF THE SKY. If you\nhaven't, then you're in for some news about the biggest undertaking\nwe've tackled to date. Of course, we still have the I. U. Round¬\ntable each Sunday morning, but we've revamped the style of it a\nlittle. FROM FREEDOM'S FORGE — we've told you about this INDIANA\nPRESENTS series before — is still going strong, and we1 re rebroad¬\ncasting it on Wednesday evenings* And it wouldn't be the I. U.\nRadio Department if we didn't have more surveys going*\nWe rather believe you'd like to meet Fred Gerber, too. Fred,\nis the newest member of our staff. He was formerly with WHA, at\nWisconsin, and came here from CBS on the west coast to take over\nas production director of the SCHOOL OF THE SKY. We'll tell you\nabout him.\nThere're a lot of other things happening, too, here-abouts.\nStick around and we'll tell you.\n#*<***"
