The\ntotal length of these programs is shown in\ncolumn 2 of Table 14. Many of these programs\nincluded some primary advertising. The total\nof such advertising is shown in column 3.\nFurther development of this analysis will be\nmost easily understood if the results are\nplaced in methodological context.\nThe analysis of secondary advertising mat¬\nter began with a sorting of the monitors’ rec¬\nords to segregate the programs which had\nbeen reported as having some secondary ad¬\nvertising.1 These record cards referred to a\ntotal of 5,453 minutes of program time, or 15\npercent of all time on the air for the eight\nstations. The record cards for programs\nwhich showed some secondary advertising\nwere then screened to isolate those programs\nin which secondary advertising occupied\nmore than 50 percent of the time. It is these\nprograms, which aggregate 2 ,678 minutes , or\n7.1 percent of total program time, which are\nincluded in the analysis summarized above.\nThe remaining “marginal” secondary adver¬\ntising program time, totalling 2,775 minutes,\nor 7.4 percent oftotal program time, has been\nignored in the analysis; i.e., these programs\nhave been treated as if they contained no sec¬\nondary advertising.\n1. For further discussion of secondary advertising\nsee Chapter V.\nSecondary Portions\nPr imary\nAdvertising\nof such Programs\nPer cent of\n(seconds)\n(seconds)\nTime on Air\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n2,550\n11,100\n4.6\n2,319\n15,141\n5.6\n82 5\n9,915\n4.91\n2,780\n10,180\n3.3\n0\n6,240\n3.9\n5,310\n31,880\n13.5*\n11,702\n43,492\n11.5\n25,486\n127,948\n7.1s\n1,647\n5,013\n1.9\n27,133\n132,961\n6.44\nThe secondary\nadvertising programs were\nthen further analyzed and\nwere classified as\neither “intermixed\" or “straight.” The dif¬\nference lay in whether the program material\nwas apparently built solely around the sales\nmessage (in which case the program was\ncalled “straight” secondary), or in whether the\nprogram material was composed of dissimilar\nelements: e.g., some entertainment or infor¬\nmation, and some advertising (in which case\nthe program was called “intermixed” second¬\nary). A summary of this analysis is pre¬\nsented in Table 15, where the totals of each\nkind of secondary advertising are shown for\nthe several stations. It there appears that\nKLAC-TV carried the most intermixed sec¬\nondary advertising, 37,846 seconds,or 10 per¬\ncent of its total time on the air. The largest\nportion of straight secondary advertising ap¬\npeared on KTTV, with 18,481 seconds, or 7.8\npercent of its time on the air other than Buena\nPark programs. Two stations carried no\nstraight secondary advertising: KTSL and\nKTLA, while one station, KFI-TV produced no\nintermixed secondary advertising programs.\nIt is of interest to note the distribution of\nsecondary advertising throughout the week.\nInterpretation of these data is perhaps most\nsignificant as they relate to the time segments\nwhich have been employed throughout this\nreport as is shown in Table 16. The heaviest\nsaturation of secondary advertising is in the\ndomestic-hours when 9.9 percent of the time\n30"
