The length of adver¬\ntisement shifts considerably as between dif¬\nferent days of the week, however. Thus, the\nlongest average primary advertisement on\nweekdays was on KLAC-TV (with 76.2 sec¬\nonds), on Saturday it was on KTTV (with 95.2\nseconds), and on Sunday it was on KLAC-TV\n(with 90.1 seconds). The shortest averages\nwere shown by KTLA on weekdays (with 50.9\nseconds), by KNBH on Saturday (with 45.3\nseconds), and by KNBH on Sunday (with 50.1\nseconds). Comparable analysis is possible\nfor each of the time segments from Appendix\nTable 12 (a) and (b).\nWithout prolonging this analysis unduly, it\nmay be of interest to look at the relation of\nadvertisements to the program segments\nwhich were considered in Chapter III. The\ndata broken down this way for all eight sta¬\ntions combined appear in Table 13.\nThe saturation of primary advertising was\ngreatest in the adult and the domestic-hours,\nwhen more than one out of every seven min¬\nutes consisted in advertising. In the children-\nhours, it was one out of ten minutes. Inspec¬\ntion of the data on length of advertisements,\nhowever, reveals that the greater saturation\nin the adult-hours was due to a heavy concen¬\ntration of shorter advertisements; the aver¬\nage length of the primary commercial adver¬\ntisements in those hours was 56 seconds, as\ncompared with 75 for the late-hours, 74 for\nthe domestic, and 64 for the children-hours.\nSecondary Advertising\nSecondary advertising material constituted\n36 hours, 51 minutes and 1 second, or 6.4\npercent of all TV program time during the\nweek exclusive of Buena Park programs (5.9\nof them are included). A summary of such\nadvertising carried bythe eight stations is of¬\nfered in Table 14. There were large differ¬\nences between stations both in the amount of\nsecondary advertising, and the proportions\nwhich it bore to total time on the air. At the\none extreme, 13.5 percent of KTTV’s pro¬\ngram time (other than Buena Park) consisted\nof secondary advertising material, while at\nthe other extreme, 3.3 percent of KECA-TV’s\nprogram time was similarly occupied.\nIt should be clearly understood that these\nfigures reflecting the amount of secondary ad¬\nvertising matter, represent the difference\nTotal length of advertisements\n(in seconds)\nAdvertising as percent of time on\nthe air\nTotal time\nTime excluding Buena Park\nNumber of advertisements\nAverage length of advertisements\n(in seconds)\nTable 13.\nPrimary Advertisements\nAdult-Hours Domestic-Hour s\n100,663 92,276\n13.31\n13.45\n1,813\n55.5\n12.52\n15.69\n1,242\n74.3\nChildren-Hour s\n58,006\nLate -Hours\n13,897\n9.88\n10.09\n911\n8.18\n9.30\n185\n63.7\n75.1\n29"
