A summary of all the program\ntime according to time segments within the\nweek is presented in Tables 5 (a), 5 (b), and\n5 (c). Comparison of the percentages of all\nprogram time, (including KFMB and Buena\nPark) devoted to classes of programs reveals\nsome large differences between programming\non weekdays, Saturday and Sunday. Thus,\nDrama (General), which amounted to one-fifth\nof all program time on weekdays, rose to al¬\nmost half of all Saturday programs (47.7 per¬\ncent), and to two-fifths (40.4 percent) of Sun¬\nday’s. Large increases appeared in some of\nthe sub-classes under Drama (General):\nWesterns rose from 4.4 percent on weekdays\nto 12.0 percent on Saturday and 11.5 percent\non Sunday; Crime drama rose from 7.0 per¬\ncent on weekdays to 8.4 percent on Saturday\n16\nand to 10.5 percent on Sunday; Romantic\nDrama rose from 2.0 percent on weekdays to\n5.8 percent on Saturday and 2.7 percent on\nSunday. Children’s Programs also reveal a\nsubstantial increase, rising from 9-0 percent\non weekdays to 20.7 percent on Saturday and\n9.0 percent on Sunday. The sub-classes which\nincreased most on weekends were: Children s\nWesterns , rising from 4.2 percent on weekdays\nto 9.7 percent on Saturday and falling off to\n4.3 percent on Sunday; Children s Crime\nDrama which rose from 0.5 percent on week¬\ndays to 1.4 percent on Saturday. Variety\n(General) programs were significantly more\nabundant on weekends than during the week:\nfrom Monday to Friday they took 8.8 percent\nof all time on the air; on Saturday they pro¬\nvided 12.4 percent, and on Sunday, 12.7 per¬\ncent of all program time. If one applies the\ngrouping test, previously used, of adding to-\ngether the Drama both General and Childrens,\non Saturday, the total of these rises to 61.0\npercent, as compared with 26.9 percent on\nweekdays, and 42.9 percent on Sunday. If to\nthis there be added the total of Variety (both\nGeneral and Housewives’), and Popular Music\n(both General and Housewives’), these three\ntypes of programs amount to 55.0 percent on\nweekdays , but jump to 78.4 percent on Saturday.\nInformation programs for Children also\nrose from less than one tenth of one percent\non weekdays to 3.4 percent on Saturday, and\n0.5 percent on Sunday. Public Issues pro¬\ngrams were more common on weekends: on\nweekdays they accounted for less than 1 per¬\ncent of the time; on Saturday they were still\nsmaller, but on Sunday, they constituted 3.3\npercent of program time. Religion, which\nwas 0.1 percent on weekdays, was altogether\nabsent on Saturday, but on Sunday rose to 4.1\npercent of total time.\nWhile weekend programming was heavier\nin these respects than programs between Mon¬\nday and Friday, it was proportionately weaker\nin other kinds of programs. Thus, Popular\nMusic, which on weekdays amounted to 7.0\npercent, was 2.0 percent on Saturday and 2.4\npercent on Sunday. An even larger decline\ntook place in Domestic programs which fell\nfrom 20.3 percent on weekdays to 6.8 percent\non Saturday and 2.3 percent on Sunday. Quiz,\nStunts and Contests programs declined mod¬\nerately from 6.9 percent, Weekdays, to 4.2\npercenton Saturday and 3.9 percent on Sunday.\nSports programs on Weekdays were 5.5 per¬\ncent; on Saturday they fell to 1.1 percent,"
