The program classes\nwhich had been relatively unrepresented\nremained so, and included Information, Public\nEvents, Public Institutions, Public Issues,\nReligion, Serious Music, Classical Drama,\nFine Arts, and Dance.\nOne Minute in Six of Los Angeles\nTV Was Devoted to Advertising\nDuring the week monitored, nearly 18 percent\nof the total time on the eight TV stations serv¬\ning Los Angeles was taken up with advertising\nof one form or another, over 19 percent if the\nBuena Park broadcasts are excluded from\nconsideration. The different stations varied\nsubstantially in this regard, with KLAC-TV\ngiving 2 6 percent of its time to advertising as\ncompared to approximately 14 percent for\nKFI-TV. The greatest proportion of time\ngiven to advertising was in the domestic-hours,\nclosely followed by the adult-hours. Both of\nthese periods devoted approximately one-fifth\nof their time to advertising; the proportion of\ndomestic-hours rises to one-fourth if the\nBuena Park broadcasts are excluded.\nFor purposes of this study, all televised\nadvertising was classified as either primary\nor secondary. Primary advertising consisted\neither of direct sales statements which oc¬\ncurred at points within programs or of similar\nstatements less than three minutes in length\nduring the station breaks between programs.\nSecondary advertising consisted either of\n“straight\" advertising programs (longer than\nthree minutes), the content of which was pri¬\nmarily concerned with the sales message of\nthe sponsor, or of programs containing “inter¬\nmixed” background advertising amounting to\nmore than 50 percent of the total time of the\nprogram.\nPrimary advertising, as defined above, oc¬\ncupied nearly 13 percent of total program\ntime in Los Angeles during the test week (ex¬\ncluding the Buena Park broadcasts). This\nproportion ranged from 19 percent down to\nten percent between the eight stations. During\nthe week of monitoring 4,151 primary adver¬\ntisements were counted. The average length\nof these advertisements was 64 seconds for\nall stations combined, all advertisements of\nmore than three minutes in length having been\nexcluded from this category. The different\nstations variedfrom an average of 78 seconds\nto an average of 53 seconds. This type of\nadvertising was most prominent in the adult\nand domestic hours where it consumed ap¬\nproximately 13 percent of the total program\ntime.\nSecondary advertising amounted to six per¬\ncent of all program time during the week, with\ndifferences between stations varying from 13\npercent to three percent, (excluding Buena\nPark broadcasts). Two stations carried no\n“straight” secondary advertising while a third\ncarried no “intermixed” advertising. The in¬\ncidence of the “straight’ secondary advertis¬\ning was greatest in the late-hours where it\namounted to three percent of all time. “Inter¬\nmixed” secondary advertising was most com¬\nmon in the domestic-hours where it took ap¬\nproximately seven percent of all program\ntime. This type of advertising was usually\nassociated with Shopping and Merchandising\nprograms, Quiz, Stunts and Contests pro¬\ngrams, Housewives’ Music programs, and\nSpectator Sports programs.\n3"
