No weather\nprogram time was added by the re-allocation.\nReligion, which formerly had been shown as\nhaving 0.6 percent of the total time, received\nan additional 105 minutes , placing its new total\nat almost 1 percent (0.9 percent).\nIt will be recalled that in the earlier anal¬\nysis it was shown that about two-fifths of total\nprogram time was supplied in the form of\nDrama, Variety, and Popular Music, and that\nthe addition of Quiz, Stunt and Contest pro¬\ngrams,Sports programs, Personalities shows,\nand the Special Feature news programs ac¬\ncounted for more than four fifths of all pro¬\ngram time (actually for 82.9 percent). After\nthe redistribution of the mixed program time,\nthe same classes (and the “Other\" time de¬\nrived from them in the analysis) account for\n81.0 percent of total time on the air. It is\nclear that no perceptible shift in emphasis in\nprogramming is revealed when one reviews\nthe small elements within the mixed program\nclasses.\n25"
