  "text": "the viewer’s mind as to when a program is in\nfact sustaining. The short program with two\nor more participating sponsors and the sus¬\ntaining program with interruptions for spot\nannouncements were not susceptible of dif¬\nferentiation in this study.\nLastly a word of explanation is called for\nconcerning the tabulation policy as regards\nthe San Diego station, KFMB, and the Buena\nPark programming. Station KFMB could not\nbe received intelligibly all the time it was on\nthe air during the week monitored, despite the\nfact that a monitor was kept stationed at the\nset all the time the station was scheduled to\nbe on the air, and despite the fact that the set\nhad been fitted with a roof-top antenna oriented\nto KFMB. The programming and advertising\nmatter monitored for this station was there¬\nfore what could be effectively viewed under\nthese conditions. It should not be understood\nas representing total programming for the sta¬\ntion, although it represents the great bulk of\nits programtime. Because for some purposes\nit may be desirable to deal only with the pro¬\ngrams telecast by the seven stations located\nin Los Angeles, alternative totals have been\npresented on the summary tables for these\nseven stations, although complete totals for\nall eight stations are offered for the purposes\nserved by consideration of all of the programs\navailable to Los Angeles viewers. As far as\nthe Buena Park broadcasts were concerned,\nalternative tabulations were prepared for the\nsummary tables in Chapter II which provide\ntotals for the inclusion as well as the exclu¬\nsion of these programs. The confusion likely\nto arise from discussion of them and the sheer\nbulk forbade the presentation of these and the\nmore detailed analytical tables.\n47"
