The\nWestern Drama (General) was all recorded on\nseven of the stations; on KECA-TV it was 97\npercent recorded. All children’s Westerns\nwere recorded on six of the stations; on KNBH\nthey were 70 percent recorded and on KTSL,\n80 percent.\nThe related type of drama program--the\nCrime program also appears in significant\nproportions on all stations, and constitutes as\nmuch as one hour of every four of program¬\nming for one station, KFI-TV. All Crime pro¬\ngrams were recorded except on KTSL where\n91 percent of the Crime Drama (General) was\nrecorded.\n11"
