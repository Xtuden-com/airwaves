In the adult-hours, 6.7 percent of\nthe program time is in secondary advertising.\nThe children-hours show the least saturation,\nwith 3.1 percent, while the late-hours run\nhigher with 4.2 percent. Intermixed secondary\nadvertising falls heaviest in the domestic-\nhours (with 7.6 percent of total time), while\nthe straight secondary advertising material\nis heaviest after 11 p.m. in the late-hours,\nwith 3.2 percent. The complete tabulation is\npresented in Table 17.\nThe question will arise, what is the rela¬\ntion of the secondary advertising programs to\nthose Domestic programs which were classed\nas “Shopping and Merchandising\"? Class\n16 (c) totalled 758 minutes over the full week\nof which 621 minutes, or about four-fifths,\nwas also classified as being secondary adver¬\ntising programming. It is of interest to note\nthat in the week monitored there were 137\nminutes of shopping programs where the in¬\nformation was not particularized as to where\nto buy what for how much. Of the 621 minutes\nof Shopping programs classed as secondary,\nalmost all were termed straight secondary;\nonly 31 minutes were designated as inter¬\nmixed secondary.\nBy far the greatest proportion, 77 percent,\nof the secondary advertising programs were\nnot Shopping programs.
