  "text": "Chapter IV\nLos Angeles TV Advertising\nAll Advertising - Primary and Secondary1\nFor all stations combined the total adver¬\ntising equalled 17.7 percent of the total time\non the air and 19.3 percent of the total ex¬\ncluding the Buena Park programs. Almost one\nminute in every five consisted of advertising\nmatter. The station with the most advertising\nmatter was KLAC-TV which led both in pri¬\nmary and in secondary advertising with an\noverall total of 26.0 percent. At the other ex¬\ntreme was KFI-TV, with 13.7 percent of its\ntime on the air devoted to advertising materi¬\nal.2 Table 8 summarizes the amount of pri¬\nmary and secondary advertising presented by\neach of the eight stations in the week during\nwhich monitoring was done.\n1. \"Primary\" advertising is that timable type of\nadvertising which employs both sound and sight simul¬\ntaneously. \"Secondary\" advertising employs one or the\nother sense, or both in a manner not permitting ready\nsegregation of advertising from non-advertising time.\n2. KTLA devoted 14.9 percent of its time on the air\nexclusive of the Buena Park programming and 918 per¬\ncent including Buena Park. To include this time would\ngive results not comparable with other stations.\nTable 8.\nLos Angeles TV Programming, May 23 - 29, 1951\nTotal Primary and Secondary Advertising\nStation\nPrimary\nAdvertising\nSecondary\nAdvert isinga\nTotal\nAdvertising\nPercentage Advertising\nis of Total Time\nTotal Time\n(seconds)\n(seconds)\n(seconds)\n(%)\n(seconds)\nKTSL\n26,719\n11,100\n37,819\n15.51\n243,900\nKNBH\n35,521\n15,141\n50,662\n18.72\n270,540\nKTLA\n20,046\n9,915\n29,961\n14.89b\n306,600\nKECA-TV\n35,193\n10,180\n45,373\n14.74\n307,920\nKFI-TV\n15,806\n6,240\n22,046\n13.69\n161,040\nKTT V\n25,970\n31,880\n57,850\n24.49c\n318,660\nKLAC-TV\n54,886\n43,492\n98,378\n26.03\n377,880\nTotal-7 stations\n214,141\n127,948\n342,089\n19.02d\n1,986,540\nKFMB\n50,701\n5,013\n55,714\n21.14\n263,520\nTotal-8 stations\n264,842\n132,961\n397,803\n19.29e\n2,250,060\nThe purpose of the study was limited, so\nfar as advertising goes, to ascertaining the\nanswer to the “how much” question, rather\nthan to questions such as “what kind,” “how\ndesirable, or undesirable.” Advertising, as\nthe term is used here, relates to commercial\nadvertisements by stations on behalf of third\nparties; the announcements on behalf of chari¬\ntable organization, and public agencies are\ndealt with later in this section as “public\nagency announcements.” The latter, however,\nwere small quantitatively, being only 7903\nseconds in length whereas the total of com¬\nmercial advertising was 397,803 seconds.\nThere are two ways of answering the ques¬\ntion, “how much advertising was there on Los\nAngeles television?” depending on how one\ndefines advertising. As is explained in Chap¬\nter V, this analysis has concerned itself with\nthe “primary” advertisements which are sep¬\narable from the program content, and “sec¬\nondary” advertisements which are not. When\nboth kinds are combined, the answer to the\nquestion appears as follows:\na) . See p. 29 for explanation\nb) . 9.77 percent including Buena Park programs\nc) . 18.15 percent including Buena Park programs\nd) . 17.22 percent including Buena Park programs\ne) . 17.68 percent including Buena Park programs\n26"
