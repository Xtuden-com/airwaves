It may fairly be\nsaid that the typical situation is for two of\nevery three hours of Los Angeles television to\nconsist of drama, variety, or popular music.\nWithout burdening the reader with similar\nanalyses of station program proportions for\nevery class of program, we will present a\nselected number of rankings for the program\nclasses which received less attention from the\nstations. The first to receive attention might\nwell be those most directly concerned with in¬\nformation:\nNews Reports Information\n(class\nla)\n(Total)\nKTTV\n6.8\nKFI-TV\n13.6\nKFI-TV\n5.9\nKNBH\n4.1\nKTLA\n5.1\nKTSL\n3.2\nKFMB\n3.1\nKTTV\n2.5\nKNBH\n2.2\nKTLA\n1.7\nKTSL\n2.0\nKFMB\n1.1\nKECA-TV\n1.4\nKLAC-TV\n1.0\nKLAC-TV\n1.0\nKECA-TV\n0.7\n(Total\n3.1)\n(Total\n2.9)\nScience Information\nKTSL 1.4\nKECA-TV 0.6\nKNBH 0\nKTLA 0\nKFI-TV 0\nKTTV 0\nKLAC 0\nKFMB 0\n(Total 0.3)\n1. These data, it will be remembered, exclude the\nBuena Park programs; earlier it was pointed out that\nthese three kinds of programs amounted to 59.8 per¬\ncent of all program time, including the Buena Park\nprograms.\nTravelogue\nInformation\nOther Information\n(General)\nKFI-TV\n5.9\nKFI-TV\n7.7\nKTSL\n0.9\nKNBH\n3.4\nKLAC-TV\n0.8\nKTTV\n2.2\nKNBH\n0.7\nKTLA\n1.7\nKFMB\n0.4\nKTSL\n0.8\nKTTV\n0.3\nKFMB\n0.7\nKTLA\n0\nKLAC-TV\n0.3\nKECA-TV\n0\nKECA-TV\n0.1\n(Total\n0.9)\n(Total\n1.7)\nChildren’s Information\nand Instruction\nKTTV\n2.2\nKTLA\n0.9\nKFMB\n0.8\nKNBH\n0.7\nKECA-TV\n0.3\nKLAC-TV\n0.1\nKFI-TV\n0\nKTSL\n0\n(Total\n0.6)\nThat stations fall rather evenly distributed on\nboth sides of the aggregate proportion of time\ngiven to News Reports, 3.1 percent, with a\nmaximum by KTTV of 6.8 percent and a mini¬\nmum by KLAC-TV, of 1.0 percent. The same\nis not true, however, of Information, where\nthe aggregate is largely influenced by the per¬\nformance of KFI-TV in providing considera¬\nbly more Travelogue and Other Information\nthan most of the stations. Science Information\nappeared on onlytwo stations, with KTSLlead-\ning with 1.4 percent of its time given over to\nthese programs. Two stations provided no\nChildren’s Information and Instruction at all,\nwhile the largest proportion was that of KTTV,\n2.2 percent. No array is presented for per¬\nsonal Relations programs (l6e), for only two\nstations, KECA-TV with 0.6 percent, and\nKLAC-TV with 0.4 percent, carried any of\nthese.\nIt is also unnecessary to construct an array\nfor station performance on Public Events.\nOnly one station carried any program time in\nthis category--KLAC-TV, with 0.4 percent.\nPublic Issues programs were carried in the\nfollowing proportions:\n15"
