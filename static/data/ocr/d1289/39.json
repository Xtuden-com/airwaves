KTTV easily outstripped\nthe other stations by itself presenting more\nthan one third of the total amount of time\ngiven to these announcements by all the sta¬\ntions. At the other extreme, KTLA presented\nthe fewest with the shortest amount of time,\n(see Table 21).\nThe public agency announcements telecast\nby all eight stations occupied 0.4 percent of\ntheir time on the air. For individual stations\nthe weekly performance in this respect ranged\nfrom KTTV’s 0.9 percentto KTLA’s 0.04 per¬\ncent. The data are presented in detail in\nAppendix A Table 13.\nWhen the public agency announcements are\nclassified according to content, the results\nare as shown in Table 22. In terms of num -\nbers, the kind of public agency announcement\nwhich was telecast most often was the Nation¬\nal Defense type, and next most popular were\nannouncements on behalf of charitable institu¬\ntions. KECA-TV supplied the largest number\nof the former, and KLAC-TV, the largest\nnumber of the latter.\n34"
