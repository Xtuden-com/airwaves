These\nDrama programs were principally motion pic¬\ntures. Second in size was the general class,\nDomestic, with 102 hours, 46 minutes or 16\npercent of all program time. These Drama\nprograms were principally motion pictures.\nSecond in size was the general class, Domes¬\ntic, with 102 hours, 46 minutes or 16 percent\nof all program time. News was third with 76\nhours, 6 minutes, or 12 percent, although two-\nthirds of this was the result of including the\nBuena Park “special event\" telecasts which\nthemselves amounted to 52 hours, 11 minutes,\nor 8 percent of total time. In fourth place\nwere Children’s programs with 64 hours, 27\nminutes, or 10 percent of all time on the air.\nVariety programs camefifth with 60 hours, 51\nminutes, or another 10 percent. Music (vir¬\ntually all Popular) provided another 6 percent.\nProgram analysis is a many-faceted prob¬\nlem. For certain analytical purposes, the\nfact that these six broad classes of programs\nconstituted 80 percent of all TV program\ntime in Los Angeles is most significant. For\nother purposes, however, it may be equally\nimportant to observe that three types of pro¬\ngrams within these six broad classes domi¬\nnated the total program structure. Thus, as\nTable 2 shows, Drama (General) when added\nto Drama (Children s) provided the largest\nsingle type of program with a total of 205\nhours, 20 minutes, or 33 percent of all\nprogram time. By similarly putting like pro¬\ngram classes together, one finds that Variety\n(General) when added to Housewives’ Variety\nand the sub-classes of Variety for Children\ngives Variety of all kinds 19 percent of total\ntime (106 hours and 58 minutes). And thirdly,\nPopular Music of all kinds amounted to 8.4\npercent of the total TV time on the air, with a\ntotal of 52 hours, 32 minutes (36 hours, 24\nminutes of Popular Music, Class 10 (c), and\n16 hours, 8 minutes of Housewives Music,\nClass 16 (g)). These three kinds of programs:\nall Drama, all Variety, and all Popular Music,\nconstituted 59.8 percent of all TV program\ntime. The remainder of the 80 percent ac¬\ncounted for by the six broad classes of pro¬\ngrams was 20 percent, which covered the re¬\nmaining sub-classes of Domestic programs,\nall the News and “special event\" programs,\nthe Children’s programs other than Drama\nand Variety, andthe Music other than Popular.\nThe broad outline of the total program\nstructure of Los Angeles TV is further\nsketched in by examining the nature of the\nlast 20 percent.
