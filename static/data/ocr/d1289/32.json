The\nconcentration of advertising in the adult-hours\n(7 to 11 p.m., seven days) was almost as high,\n20.0 percent (20.2 percent if Buena Park is\nexcluded). In the children-hours (5 to 7 week¬\ndays and sign-on to 7 Saturday and Sunday)\n13.0 percent of the time was devoted to ad¬\nvertising (13.2 percent excluding Buena Park).\nAnd in the late hours (after 11 p.m.), 11.9\npercent of the time consisted of advertising\n(or 13.4 percent, excluding Buena Park). The\nactual data are as shown in Table 9* Similar\ncalculations may be performed for each of the\nstations, using the statistical data presented\nin Appendix A Tables 1 and 11, and Tables 27\nand 28 of this Chapter.\nPrimary Advertising\nPrimary advertising material occupied 73\nhours, 34 minutes and 2 seconds, or 11.8 per¬\ncent of all TV program time during the week\n(and 12.8 percent of the total excluding Buena\nPark).1 A summary of the amount of such\nadvertising carried by the eight stations is\npresented in Table 10. There was substan¬\ntially more advertising on the average week¬\nday (a total of 11 hours, 50 minutes and 51\nseconds of advertising) than on Saturday and\nSunday (when it was between 6 and 7 hours).\nThere were also sizable differences between\nthe amounts of primary advertising carried by\nthe several stations. KLAC-TV, for example,\nwith its 15 hours of primary advertising, ex¬\nceeded KTLA (the station operating all seven\ndays which carried the least primary adver¬\ntising) by 173 percent in sheer quantity of\nprimary advertising.\n1. These figures probably understate somewhat the\nactual number of hours consumed in primary advertis¬\ning. This is indicated by the fact that duplicate but in¬\ndependent monitoring of two stations over a period of\ntwo days during the test week showed that each series\nof monitors failed to record occasional advertisements\nwhich the other series succeeded in timing. The inde¬\npendent totals on each day corresponded closely, with\nless than five percent discrepancy in each case, but on\nboth days individual advertisements which were caught\nby one group of monitors were missed by the other. If\nthese omissions had not occurred the total figure for\ntimed advertising might have been as much as ten per¬\ncent higher than that reported'above.\nTable iu.\nLos Angeles TV Programming, May 23-29, 1951\nTotal Number and Length of Primary Advertisements\nPrimary Advertisements\nStation\nWeekdays\nSaturday\nSunday\nTotal\nNo.\nLength\nNo.\nLength\nNo.\nLength\nNo.\nLength\n(seconds)\n(seconds)\n(seconds)\n(seconds)\nKTSL\n402\n22,664\n28\n1,705\n39\n2,350\n469\n26,719\nKNBH\n577\n30,845\n38\n1,723\n59\n2,953\n674\n35,521\nKTLA\n252\n12,831\n59\n3,428\n63\n3,787\n374\n20,046\nKECA-TV\n384\n26,732\n69\n4,539\n56\n3,922\n509\n35,193\nKFI-TV\n246\n15,806\n--\n--\n--\n--\n246\n15,806\nKTT V\n382\n21,623\n26\n2,474\n33\n1,873\n44!\n25,970\nKLAC-TV\n597\n45,512\n40\n3,698\n63\n5,676\n700\n54,886\nTotal (7)\n2840\n176,013\n260\n17,567\n313\n20,561\n3413\n214,141\nKFMB\n526\n37,246\n110\n7,094\n102\n6,361\n738\n50,701\nTotal (8)\n3366\n213,259\n370\n24,661\n415\n26,922\n4151\n264,842\n27"
