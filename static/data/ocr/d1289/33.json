The percentages which\nadvertisement time bore to time on the air\nwere as shown in Table 11. For the full week\none finds the highest saturation on KFMB--\nwith 19.3 percent. If one looks to the seven\nstations actually located in Los Angeles, the\nhighest saturation was on KLAC-TV, with 14.5\npercent. KFMB led all the stations on week¬\ndays (with 21.7 percent), on Saturday (with\n15.9 percent), and on Sunday (with 13.5 per¬\ncent). Of the Los Angeles stations, KLAC-TV\nhad the largest saturation of primary adver¬\ntising on weekdays (with 16.4 percent), and on\nSunday (with 10.4 percent), but KTTV sur¬\npassed it on Saturday (with 10.3 percent). The\nlowest saturation throughout the week was on\nKFI-TV with 9.8 percent. On weekdays\nKFI-TV had the least saturation (9.8 percent)\nbut on Saturday KNBH with 7.2 percent and on\nSunday KTTV (with 5.3 percent) were the low¬\nest in this respect. A comparable analysis\nmay be made for each of the time segments\nof the day throughout the week from the infor¬\nmation presented in Appendix A Table 12 (a)\nand (b).\nThus far the analysis has dealt with the\nlength ofprimary advertisements. They might\nalso be counted as separate announcements.\nIf they are,the following results appear (from\n7.2 9.4 13.1\n7.6* 8.2 10.03\n9.7 8.9 11-4\n9.8\n10.3 5.3 11.05\n7.8 10.4 14.5\n8.2 8.7 11.97\n15.9 13.5 19.3\n9.5 9.4 12.8\"\n6. 11.0 percent including Buena Park programs\n7. 10.8 percent including Buena Park programs\n8. 12.4 percent including Buena Park programs\n9. 11.8 percent including Buena Park programs\nTable 10): Over the full week there were 4,151\nprimary commercial advertisements. The\ngreatest incidence was on weekdays when\nthere was an average of 673 per day, while on\nSaturday there were 370, and on Sunday, 415.\nOf all eight stations, KFMB had the largest\nnumber of such advertisements on Saturday\nand on Sunday, but KLAC-TV easily surpassed\nit on weekdays. Of the Los Angeles stations,\non Saturday KECA-TV carried the largest\nnumber of such announcements, while on Sun¬\nday KTLA and KLAC-TV were tied for first\nplace. At the other extreme, KFI-TV overall\nhad the smallest number of primary adver¬\ntisements, as well as the smallest number on\nweekdays; on Saturday and on Sunday, KTTV\nstands at the bottom of the list.\nStill another dimension of primary adver¬\ntisements exists: namely the average length\nof advertisements. Stated in these terms, the\nevidence develops as in Table 12. Overall,\nthe average length of primary advertisements\nwas 64 seconds with weekday advertisements\nbeing slightly shorter than those on Saturday\nand on Sunday.1 As between stations,\nKLAC-TV with 78.4 seconds showed the long¬\nest average primary advertisement. At the\nother extreme, KNBH’s 52.7 seconds placed it\n1. The average length of timed advertisements in\nthis study is not comparable with the similar data in\nNAEB Study No. 1 on New York TV because in Los\nAngeles advertisements 3 minutes in length or longer\noutside of programs were counted as untimable pro¬\ngrams.
