These\nround table discussions are based\non the results of The Purdue\nOpinion Poll For Young People\na continual inventory of these at¬\ntitudes conducted by Dr. H. H.\nRemmers, Director of Purdue's\nDivision of Educational Reference.\nPOPYP measures regularly the\nreactions of high-school pupils in\nthirteen states to about twenty\nstatements. Schools send their\nresults to Purdue, where all\nresponses are totaled and ana¬\nlyzed. A report of the results is\nsent to the schools for use in dis¬\ncussion, curriculum revision, reme¬\ndial teaching, and explaining\ncauses of misconceptions which\npupils have.\nEach week six select high-\nschool pupils from Lafayette\nschools discuss with John Hender¬\nson, Educational Supervisor at\nWBAA, a question based on one\nor more items taken from the Pur¬\ndue Poll. Programs are spontane¬\nous, and free discussion is en¬\ncouraged. A teacher's manual\nwith study references for each\ndiscussion is free upon request.\nH. H.
