Weak\nspots have been strengthened,\nsome new names appear, but\notherwise you will find the same\nsound information that has proved\nso helpful in the past. All the\ndevelopments of the past are in¬\ncluded in this year's Agriculture\nSchool.\nFor those who may be using the\nAgriculture School for the first\ntime, a word of explanation. The\ntopics for the school were selected\nby Mr. L. A. Wood, Tippecanoe\nCounty agriculture teacher. He\nhas based his selection of mater¬\nial on the state curriculum and on\nthe timeliness of each subject.\nThis series is designed to comple¬\nment the year's work in vocational\nagriculture classes. Few teach¬\ners have used all of the programs\nin past years. However, many\nhave selected programs that have\nfitted best into their schedule.\nA teacher's manual has been\nprepared again this year. It is\ncomplete with suggestions for the\nuse of the series, having lists of\nquestions for discussion with stu¬\ndents after each ’broadcast and a\nlist of references for subject. This\nteacher's manual can be obtained\nfree of charge from WBAA. Please\nuse the order form on page 15.\nSeptember\n18 Selecting the Variety, Fertilizing and\nSowing Wheat\nGeorge Enfield\n25 Management and Feeding of Sows\nand Gilts\nJohn Schwab\n2 Feeding and Management of Laying\nHens in Fall and Winter\nJoe Sicer\n9 Repairing Farm Machinery\nL.
