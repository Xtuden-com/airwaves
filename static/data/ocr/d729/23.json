We are beginning immediate\nproduction on the series outlined in the Agreement, look¬\ning toward completion of the various series as rapidly\nas possible* In the near future we shall begin to submit\nprogram proposals and audition tapes for the remaining\ntwenty-two and one-half hours.\nSince, apparently, so little is known about KPFA, I can\nappreciate your anxieties concerning the quality of the\nvarious programs to be produced. I think, however, that\nwe shall be able to dispel any apprehensions as soon as\nyou’ve had a chance to hear some of the work produced.\nThank you very much for your prompt and considerate action\nin sending the initial installment of the grant. I’m look¬\ning forward to Harry Skornia’s visit to the West Coast on\nthe last leg of his grand tour. It will be a great relief\nto have someone from the NAEB actually see our set up here.\nWith best personal regards\ns.\nTELEPHONE AShberry 3-6767\nA NON-PROFIT EDUCATIONAL CORPORATION\nLEWIS HILL, Chairman\nRICHARD MOORE, Vice-Chairman\nELEANOR McKINNEY, Secretary\nKARL ZAPF, Treasurer"
