It would he a grievous waste to pour that money into XPIA as it\nstands.\nIf you can make your way through the enclosure as an addendum to these\ncomments you will he tolerably up to date. To the best of my knowledge at the\nmoment the situation is irretrievable.\nYour latest note mentions with sorrow and nostalgia the export project.\nIn the few moments I have had lately to collect my wits it has appeared more\nand more forcibly to me that we had something there, something of transcendent\nimportance if properly executed. Very early in August I am going to write you\nat length again on this particular subject. I aim inclined to think it ought\nbe done, but more ambitiously than we first imagined, and in a slightly .\ndifferent way. Anyhow don*t abandon the thought until we have had some furÂ¬\nther communication about it.\nI will not elaborate on the various lessons I have learned about the\nequalitarian society or on the keen regret l feel for any embarrassment you\nmay have suffered personally regarding the Center grant. I count on your\nsensitive antennae in such matters.\nBest wishes always,\n(SIGNED) Lew\n- Glad the Jefferson film worked out so well. Save me a showing someday."
