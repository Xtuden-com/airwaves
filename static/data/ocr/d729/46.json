Skomia to Me*. F* Daniel Frost III, dated July\n29, 1953â€¢\nWo have emninsd certified copies of the Articles\nof Incorporation and copies of the By-Laws, the Minute\nBooks and other relevant records of Pacifica Foundation.\nOsx the basis of this examination it is apparent that the\ncorporate business of the Foundation has in the past been\ngenerally conducted in an informal manner. While all of\nthe meetings of the Committee of Directors and of the\nExecutive Membership over a period of years have been\nattended by a substantial majority of the membership, it\ncannot be said that corporate formalities* such as those\nregarding notice of meetings* have been observed with\nregularity. With respect to the period ending June 27*\n1953* we can only conclude that the composition of the\nCommittee of Directors and of the Eaecutive Maabership\nwas and that the corporation* s aanagemant\nand agents enjoyed at least a de facto status. In all\nother respects this opinion is confined to the period\nsubsequent to June 27* 1953*"
