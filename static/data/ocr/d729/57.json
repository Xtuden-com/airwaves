The newspapers here like people every¬\nwhere relish nothing more that the Fall of Utopia.\nLitigation of this matter would have spread its ugliness\nover the whole metropolitan district, ruining the stationfs\nintegrity anyway#\nSince I last wrote there have been further efforts to\nmeet, explore, etc. One example: Frank Freeman, Emeritus\nDean of Education, University of California, offered to\nform a small mediation group of outside persons if Hamil¬\nton1 s group would join in a private discussion of the\nsituation. They refused. Their moral as well as practical\nposition is of course quite desperate. They have chosen,\nhowever, to exercise their majority of one (excluding\nMoore, Chiarito and Zapf from membership) to legalize this\nposition. The entire subject has been plunged into the\nmost degrading and paranoid sort of personal behavior.\nThe possibilities are exhausted, and for this reason as\nwell as economic necessity I have been obliged to withdraw\nfinally from Pacifica to turn to other things.\nIt does not appear likely to me that the NAEB can withhold\nthe $15,000 indefinitely. For better or worse there was a\ncontract executed with Pacifica in which the first $15,000\nis immediately payable, and I think you will find the\nHamilton group of a threatening disposition legally if that\nmoney is not forwarded. The only possible consolation here\nis the perverted one that these people will make extreme\nefforts to justify their actions, and may for that reason\noutdo themselves to get a few decent programs back to you.\nThere were already a few hours of tapes on hand which\nwould be useful to the NAEB.\n/s/ LEWIS HILL"
