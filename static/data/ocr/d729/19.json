Skomla, Is signing\nthe contract on behalf of Oraydon Ausmus, for HA SB. In\naccordance with one of the terms of agreement, I am trans¬\nmitting herewith a check In the amount of $15#000, the\nfirst installment of the grant.\nHarry Is writing you tomorrow with some additional\nthoughts on the arrangements. I assure you we wish to\nproceed and carry out the agreement, in all respects, in\nline with the Intent of the Center, and the agreement\nbetween MAKE and the Center. On the other hand, I would be\nless than honest if X did not here indicate that we have\nconsiderable apprehension about the quality of programs\nwhich we might receive, even after our mutual agreement\nof what the programs are to be. «e*re hoping that we1 re wrong,\nbut if the quality of programs produced is such that they are\nnot distributable through the HA© Tape Network, then we\nwould have no alternative but to withhold the second\ninstallment on November 1. This is implicit in our agreement\nwith the Center.\nSincerely,\nFrank I. Sehooley\nTreasurer\nFES5fah\nEnel.\necs C. Scott Fletcher\n0. H. Griffiths\nOraydon Ausmus /\nHairy Skomla /\nX"
