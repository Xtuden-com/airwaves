The only difficulty is that the\nlists provide \"an embarrassment of riches.\" With titles like \"Science\nand Security” and \"The Study of International Relations and Anthropology\"\nand with speakers like Vannevar Bush, Franz Alexander, and J. Robert\nOppanheimer, a choice is most difficult. We attempted to check, off ma¬\nterial on the lists, which we are returning, and found ourselves mark¬\ning about half of the titles.\nOur suggestion is that, since the most unpromising title can lead to\nsomething fascinating and the most promising speaker can let one down,\nyou people select those you think the best, not paying too much atten¬\ntion to our preferences according to the check marks, and arrange a se¬\nries. We will submit the list to the Radio Network Committee's Accep¬\ntance Subcommittee. (Since we believe the committeemen have already\nheard many KPFA recordings, we hope they will be willing to by-pass the\nsample tapes.) If the list la approved by the Subcommittee, you may\nthen go ahead with the editing.\nWe would, of course, like the programs tailored to 29*3D or 59*30 with\nthe times running under rather than over these limits. There need be\nno rush in the editing as we almost certainly will not be able to use\nthe programs before next July at the earliest. (Tou might take this\ninto consideration when selecting the programs for timeliness.)\nMost sincerely,\nHany J. Skomie\nExecutive Director\nJRH/HJS/cr\nCC: F, E. Schooley\nJohn R. Holt"
