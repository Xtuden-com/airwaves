Dear Mr. Moores\nIn ay telephone conversation with Mr. Lewis Hill on Friday,\nJuly 10, we concurred in the advisability of the return of\nthe check received by Pacifica Foundation in connection\nwith a series of radio program directly authorised by the\nRational Association of Educational Broadcasters operating\nunder a grant from the Kducational Television and Radio\nCenter. It had been my thought that in all likelihood the\ncheck in question was the original check from the Center\nmade out to the HAEB, this in turn, being endorsed over to\nPacifica Foundation.\nHowever, I note that the cheek enclosed with your letter of\nJuly 10 is a check made out by RaRB. Accordingly this is\nbeing returned immediately to HAEB, and I suggest that you\nfollow it with a letter from Pacifica to HAHB setting forth\nthe reasons for its return.\nlou will appreciate, I am sure, that under the circumstances\nthe direct line of relationship is between BAEB and the\nPacifica Foundation, the Center entering into this only in¬\ndirectly.\nSincerely,\nC. Scott Fletcher\nccs Mr. Lewis Hill\nMr. Frank Schooley\nMr. George Overton\n(Enclosed check)"
