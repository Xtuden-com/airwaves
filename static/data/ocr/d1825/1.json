A glance at Mr. Gjesdal’s outstanding career\nseems ample assurance for a thoroughly enjoyable\nand enlightening speech.\nBorn at Dyvaag, Norway, in 1909, he studied law\nat the University of Oslo, and journalism in Sweden\nand the United Kingdom. From 1922 to 1940 he was\na reporter, and a foreign and war correspondent in\nWestern and Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Mid¬\ndle and Far East and Indonesia for Norwegian news¬\npapers. In 1940 he held the post of press officer of\nthe Norwegian Army High Command, and from\n1940 to 1941 he served as press attache with the\nNorwegian Legation in Washington. He then became\ndirector of the Norwegian Information Service in\nLondon, a post he held until 1945. Until his UNESCO\nappointment in 1955, he was principal director and\nlater deputy under-secretary of the UN Department\nof Public Information in New York.\nThe banquet will reach its finale with a one-hour\nfloor show crowded with light-hearted entertainment.\nThrough satires, spoofs and take-offs, the show will\ndepict educational broadcasting’s history with par¬\nticular stress on its comical aspects. Presently, sta¬\ntion managers are being alerted by William G. Harley __\nof WHA-TV, who is producing the show, to submit\nfurther suggestions on possible talent, material and\nideas to be used in the show.\nDuring the banquet, deserving members and or¬\nganizations will be honored with NAEB awards and\ncitations.\n“Broadcasting for World Understanding” will be\nthe subject of discussion during the Thursday morn¬\ning session. The discussion, chaired by Seymour Sie¬\ngel, director of WNYC, will be enlivened by reports\nfrom Dr. Keith Engar, 1956 Fulbright Fellow; Ray¬\nmond Hurlbert, Alabama Educational Television\nCommission; Miss Gertrude McCance, supervisor of\nschool broadcasts, Department of Education, Winni¬\npeg, Canada; Chloe Fox, executive director, Broad¬\ncasting Foundation of America; and Edwin Randall,\nAmerican Friends Service Committee, Philadelphia.\nAt the 2 p. m. General Session Harold McCarty,\ndirector of radio-TV education, University of Wis¬\nconsin, will take up the “Coordinate Uses of Radio\nand Television.”\nFourth Day — ELECTION OF NAEB OFFICERS\nThe convention’s closing\nday, Friday November 1,\nwill open with a morning\nGeneral Session at which\nDr. Harry K.
