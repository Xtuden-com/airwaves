Senate\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Senator Holland:\ni.\nahe Carnegie Commission report on \"Public Television\"\nhas attracted nationwide attention. Many of its findings\ncan be applied to radio and its recommendations must be\nparalleled for radio.\nSenator Magnuson will soon introduce legislation re¬\nnewing the ETV Facilities Act, if he has not already done\nso. This Act presumably has administration backing. Radio\nshould be a part of this legislation. Needless to remark,\nsaturation* of radio, its immediacy, its intimacy, flexi¬\nbility, and its appeal to the imagination, especially in\nsuch areas as music, drama, literature, public affairs, and\nlanguages, make it an obvious means of realization of many\nof the goals being set in public education. Its relatively\n-iass costly nature, both in equipment and personnel makes\n— ^ ^ ^2.tural medium. Its universality makes it doubly use¬\nful. The large number of educational-non-commercial radio\nstations now in existence, and their continued interest in\nthe field offer a ready-made resource which needs to be\nrapped. Surely such a medium must be fairly considered and\n_ntelligently utilized in the overall plan for public infor¬\nmation and education.\nInstructional Materials\nWUSF SiS^ST14\nAudio Visual Services"
