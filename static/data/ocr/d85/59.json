Staggers* Chairman\nInterstate and Foreign Commerce Committee\nThe House of Representatives\nWashington* D.C*\nBear Sir;\nAs a member of the teaching profession and an educational\nbroadcaster* X am much concerned about raising the general level\nof education of our population* X understand that In the near\nfuture there will be legislation concerning both educational\nRadio and educational Television,\nSince radio has already proven the ability to reach more\npeople at one time than any other medium* X feel that it is a\nnatural way of raising the general level of education of our\npopulation* The possibilities seem to be limited only by the\nfunds available. Both Sducational Radio and Educational Tele*\nvision have had to struggle for existence in this country* whereas\nin some other nations* the cultural burden is carried on with\ngovernment support.\nThe Report of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Tele¬\nvision gives many fine suggestions for continuing support of\nEducational Television. However* X hope that any legislation\nresulting from that report will also contain support for\nEducational Radio because radio at times can be much more\neffective than television.\nX trust that you will support any legislation which\ncomes out of the Carnegie Commission’s Report and that\nEducational Radio will be included In this legislation. X would\nappreciate receiving copies of any legislation concerning\neducational broadcasting from your office.\nYours truly*\nwm/im\nDavid 8.
