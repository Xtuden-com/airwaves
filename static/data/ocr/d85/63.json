  "text": "The Honorable Vance Ilartke\nPage 4\nFebruary 26, 1968\nI believe the case for exemptions for educational\nbroadcasters is strong. If Congress feels that the\ncase is not sufficiently strong to grant complete\nexemption, I hope fervently that adequate provisions\nwill be made so that licensing for use of all copy¬\nrighted materials may be handled by one agency, one\nlicense, and by one annual fee...which wiil be a\nreasonable one that will not stifle education and\nculture at one of its major access points for the\ngeneral public.\nIf you have further questions about WBAA's production\nand programming, or about the ways in which S. 597\nwould handcuff our existing operation, please address\nthem to me. I hope you will see fit to convey my\narguments to members of the Judiciary Committee, and\nto the Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and\nCopyrights.\nThank you very much for your consideration of edu¬\ncational broadcasting’s problems under the proposed\ncopyright law revision.\nSincerely,\nJRD/jlb\nJohn R. DeCamp\nManager"
