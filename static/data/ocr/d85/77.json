CHIEF CLERK\n'UiCmfeb ^bencxie\nCOMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n• February 22, 1967\nMr. Myron M. Curry, Director\nKFJM & Closed Circuit TV\nUniversity of North Dakota\nGrand Forks, North Dakota\nDear Mr. Curry:\nJust a note to acknowledge and thank you for your letter\nof February 18 with further reference to our visit last week con¬\ncerning the Educational Television Facilities Act.\nMr. Curry, I appreciated the opportunity to visit with\nyou and I really got a lot out of it. As I indicated to you then,\nI have had no complaints over the operation of educational tele¬\nvision and at this time I see no reason why I will not be able to\nsupport this legislation. As you can well imagine, though, it is\nvery difficult to give a firm commitment until the Senate Commerce\nCommittee has held its hearings and reported the bill to the Senate.\nNo one will know until then just what the final provisions of this\nAct will be.\nI am sure that the Senate Commerce Committee will hold\nadequate hearings on this legislation and that those representing\neducational radio will be given ample opportunity to be heard.\nWith kindest personal regards.\nSincerely yours.\nT. ]\n|("
