DeCamp\nManager\nStation WBAA\nPurdue University\nLafayette, Indiana 47907\nDear Mr. DeCamp:\nMy understanding is that the Senate Judiciary may well\nreport out E.R. 2512, which passed the House of RepreÂ¬\nsentatives April 11, 1967, instead of S. 597. What\nmodifications the Senate might make in the House version\nI have no way of knowing, of course.\nShould the measure he passed by the Senate and then go\nto conference, I will be glad to do what I can to be\nhelpful along the lines you suggest.\nSincerely,\nCharles A. Halleck\nCAE/Ah"
