C.# may I call your attention\nto the forthcoming results of a national survey of educational stations in\nthe U.S.T The data, when synthesised, will provide an up-to-date picture\nof the current e tat he of educati onal radio facilities; to data, 125 have\nreturned detailed replies. It is hoped that when the pending TV\nFacilities legislation enters hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee\nit will be possible far educational radio to present its case for inclusion\nin the extended Act. The forthcoming data should help the Committee and\nthe legislators to make a soundly considered decision about supporting\neducational radio a© an economic, flexible, pervasive medium easily used\nat the local level by local citizens.\nIt is my hop© that you can see fit at least to assure a hearing for\neducational radio, and at most to lend active support to its support and\nfurthter development.\nSincerely yours.\nMyron N.
