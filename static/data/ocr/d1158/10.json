All cities in America, comparable in size to Indianapolis,\nhave at least one clear channel, 50 KW station, Indianapolis does not\nhave, PM offers the state an opportunity to have facilities equal to\nthose in other states, both commercially and educationally.\nThe following advantages of PM over AM as now or in the future\navailable, cannot be denied:\n1. Ninety percent Freedom from static.\n2. Freedom from station interference*\n3. Greater Freedom from fading.\n4. More faithful transmission - the ability to transmit sounds and\nmusic not even remotely possible by AM, because of its limited\nband.\n5. Greater economy due to the fact that FM eliminates the necessity\nfor costly amplitude modulation tubes and power for their operaÂ¬\ntion. AM is, as compared to FM, wasteful of electric power.\nHowever, FM also has the following disadvantages:\n1. The coverage radius is not as great, although more dependable\nfor the region covered.\n2. FM transmission, being so exact and faithful, suffers more from\nbeing sent over wires. Network FM and television operation will\nprobably be mostly through the air, by relay broadcast, rather\nthan along telephone lines, as for AM. However, developmental\nwork is in progress on lines which may produce a type capable of\nhandling FM and television with little loss of quality.\n3* However, higher transmission fidelity, defects in equipment and\nperformance will be more obvious in FM than in AM. Hence the\nneed for better equipment and more exacting standards than for"
