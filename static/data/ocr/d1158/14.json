Our only desire is to have adequate facilities for\nthe accomplishment of first-class broadcasting work with a single build¬\ning for both studios and transmitter. This arrangement would enable\ndoubling up on the services of engineers and other members of the staff,\nand would eliminate the cost of separate buildings, power loss along\nexpensive lines, and the maintenance costs of such facilities. Whether\na new building should be used, or some existing building, such as the\nspeech section of the Auditorium, should be determined on the basis of\nactual needs.\nIt should be pointed out, hov/ever, that if our station must wait\nfor slow, post-war building for housing, Indiana University*s new\nstation will be starting at a great disadvantage - for Michigan, Iowa,\nIllinois and others already have adequate temporary quarters without\nwaiting for new buildings, although new'buildings will soon be built\nto house their new FM stations."
