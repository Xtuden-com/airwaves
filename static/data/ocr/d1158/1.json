  "text": "Report and Recommendations to the President on\nRadio Plans for Indiana University\nThe material and recommendations submitted in this report are the\nresult of several conferences with representatives of various adminisÂ¬\ntrative divisions of the University, and the result of securing the most\nup-to-date information available for the planning of a station. It is\nthe opinion of all to whom it was submitted for criticism that this\nreport is sufficiently complete to present a well-balanced picture of\nour immediate needs and it is Intended to replace all previous, reports\non radio planning.\nIt represents what the University needs to do competent and thorough\nwork in broadcasting and in training students for radio. It is based on\nthe experiences of radio stations in educational institutions throughout\nthe country, and the requests herein are much more modest than the grants\nfor the same purpose at the University of Oklahoma ($300,000.00), the\nUniversity of Michigan ($175,000*00), the University of Illinois\n($100,000.00) for expansion of present ($40,000) staff and equipment\n($60,000), and others. However we believe that with the equipment,\npersonnel, and budget hero outlined, provided that we have adequate\ntechnical assistance in our choice of materials, to eliminate possible\nwaste and insure careful planning, we can operate a station and offer a\nthorough student training program."
