The Commission,\nhowever, soon began to cut down the\nprivileges of some of the college stations,\nand educators then began to realize that\nCongress had given the Federal Radio\nCommission more control over the edu¬\ncational functions of the states than\never before had been placed in the hands\nof a federal agency.\nThe Federal Radio Commission did\nnot protect the educational stations as\nthe '\"Congressmen believed it would. It\naccepted the fact that radio broadcast¬\ning was classified in the business world\nas an amusement enterprise, supported\nby the sale of advertising. Broadcasting\nas it existed in America was a business,\nmore nearly related to the vaudeville\ntheater and the movies than to the pub¬\nlic school, the college, and the university.\nFrom the point of view of the radio in¬\ndustry, as of the theatrical profession,\nthe public was to be exploited rather\nthan educated. Both assumed that\namusement was the major interest of\nthe people of the United States. Both\nbelieved that only a small minority of\nthe radio listeners was interested in edu¬\ncation. The commercial broadcaster’s\naim was to reach everybody, including\nimportant minorities, so material of an\neducational nature was broadcast. How¬\never, most of the hours when the largest\naudiences could be reached were devoted\nto amusement. Inasmuch as collecting\nfees from American listeners appeared to\nthe broadcasters to be more difficult and\nless profitable than selling time to adver¬\ntisers, in spite of the experience in other\nAn address before the Second Annual Institute for\nEducation by Radio, Columbus, Ohio, June 9. 1931.\nMr. Armstrong Perry is director of the Service Bureau\nof the National Committee on Education by Radio,\nand is associated with the Payne Fund.\ncountries, advertising became the means\nof producing income.\nThe members of the Federal Radio\nCommission were not educators.\nCommercial pressure—The com¬\nmercial broadcasters, being more ag¬\ngressive than the educators, surrounded\nthe Commission with such influences and\nbrought such pressure to bear, that it was\nnatural, perhaps, that the Commission\nshould overlook the fact that education\nand business have radically different ob¬\njectives, and that it should agree with\nthe commercial broadcasters in believing\nthat public education, so far as radio was\nconcerned, should be in the control of\nmen and corporations who were inter¬\nested mainly in making profits.\nThe control of radio is the basic prob¬\nlem. The whole radio industry and some\neducators have tried to keep this prob¬\nlem in the background until all broad¬\ncasting channels should have passed into\nthe control of business corporations. It\nwas kept in the background until 94.5\npercent of the channels had been given\nby the Federal Radio Commission to\nstations devoted to amusement and ad¬\nvertising, and until only about fifty of\nour more than six hundred American\nbroadcasting stations remained free\nfrom cominercial control and censorship.\nCommercial broadcasters have offered\neducation magnificent gifts on one hand,\nand on the other hand have made a de¬\ntermined effort to take away from the\npublic schools, colleges, and universities\nthe fundamental right, left to them by\nthe Constitution of the United States, of\nusing any method of education and\nkeeping education free from any obliga¬\ntion to promote the interests of particu¬\nlar commercial groups. They have of¬\nfered more time on the air than the\neducators have accepted. They have\nspent more money on educational radio\nprograms than the educators have, and\nhave made these programs more widely\navailable than any that have originated\nin the halls of learning. They have given\noutstanding educators high positions, at¬\ntractive titles, and much publicity for\nserving, or appearing to serve, in an ad¬\nvisory capacity to commercial compa¬\nnies. But they have fought every at¬\ntempt to reserve any radio channels and\nkeep them under control of officials\nelected by tlj& citizens of the states to\n[91]\nadminister public schools, colleges, and\nuniversities. They have said, by official\nastion of their leading trade organiza¬\ntions, that the demand of educators for\nreservation of radio channels is based on\na totally false conception of the function\nof broadcasting stations, and have re¬\nvealed that the industry maintains state\nand national organizations for the pur¬\npose of controling legislation.\nThese methods resemble closely those\nof other industries based on the use of\npublic property. It is natural that they\nshould, for some of the largest public\nutility corporations are associated with\nthe dominant radio group, and when the\nfirst broadcasting chain was organized\nits first president was a man who had\nbeen serving as the public relations\ndirector of a public utilities corporation.\nHe had revealed with the utmost frank¬\nness his plan for subsidizing educators\nso that they might shape education to\nthe advantage of public utilities corpora¬\ntions.\nEducators organize—Few educators\nhave objected to granting the use of part\nof the radio channels to commercial con¬\ncerns, to use for their own profit. It was\nnot until the trend toward monopoly had\nreduced the uncensored channels to a dis¬\nappearing remnant that educators organ¬\nized to save the birthright of the public\nschools and institutions of higher learn¬\ning.\nThen they studied the history of the\ndealings of the Federal Radio Commis¬\nsion with the educational stations.\nHere are some of the facts that were\nconsidered:\nThe Radio Committee of the Associa¬\ntion of Land Grant Colleges and Uni¬\nversities reported:\nThe primary purpose of the Radio Commit¬\ntee is to protect the interest of the Land Grant\nInstitutions on the air so far as practicable. It\nhas been the hope of several members of the\nCommittee that they could secure from the\nFederal Radio Commission definite rulings\nwhich would ensure, at least to every state and\nparticularly to the Land Grant Institution\nthereof, a definite wavelength or period, which\ncould be used by the institutions for educa¬\ntional broadcasting. This had not yet been ac¬\ncomplished at the end of August, 1929.\nIt has not been accomplished yet. The\naction of the Commission, in compelling\neducational stations to share channels\nand time with commercial stations, has"
