Here I had the opportunity to take the five-\nday factory training course covering the operation\nand maintenance of the Ampex Videotape Recorder.\nThree days were devoted to the study of schematics\nand block diagrams of the various chassis employed\nin recording the video and audio signals of a TV pro¬\ngram on magnetic tape. For the last two days of the\ncourse, the students go through the setup procedure\nas outlined in the comprehensive instruction manual\nfurnished with each recorder.\nThe Ampex Videotape Recorder consists of two\nstandard racks of electronic equipment and the con¬\nsole, which contains the transport mechanism and\nother electronics. All rack and console wiring is com¬\npleted at the factory. In fact, the racks are bolted\ntogether and shipped that way. Each recorder is\nplaced in operation and given a final test at the fac¬\ntory to see that it meets operating specifications be¬\nfore shipment. When the equipment arrives at its\ndestination and is uncrated, installation consists of\nhooking it up to the 60-cycle AC power circuits, mak¬\ning video connections and the rack-to-console wiring.\nThis latter wiring is a very simple job with only three\ninterconnecting cables involved, two of which termin¬\nate in factory-mounted spade type terminal strips\nwhich connect to appropriate terminals in the end of\nthe console. The third cable contains ten coaxial cables\nwhich require soldered connections to the proper\nconsole terminal. Once these connections are made,\nyou are ready to begin the initial check-out pro¬\ncedure which is detailed step by step in the instruc¬\ntional manual.\nFor proper set-up and maintenance, a dual trace is\nrequired on the test oscilloscope. Ampex recommends\na Tektronix Model 541 with a dual input pre-ampli¬\nfier and also a high gain pre-amplifier unit for certain\nother tests. A reference tape for initial tests is sup¬\nplied with each unit as well as a micrometer depth\ngauge for measuring head protrusion from the rota¬\nting drum. A standard test tape is being developed\nwhich will be supplied with all machines. Degaussing\nis accomplished at present with the conventional bulk\ntype unit now used for erasing audio tapes, since the\nrecorder has no erase head. An accessory unit is now\nbeing developed which will make degaussing an auto¬\nmatic process for consistent erasure.\nThe recording tape has been vastly improved over\nNEWSLETTER"
