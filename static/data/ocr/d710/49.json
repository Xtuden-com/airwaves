  "text": "A GLIMPSE AT THE FUTURE\nEducational broadcasters feel a modest\npride in the quantity, the diversity of sub¬\nject matter, and the quality of the material\ndistributed by the network. They feel in¬\ntense enthusiasm for the future. The net¬\nwork is currently being organized on a\npermanent, business-like basis. When this\norganization is accomplished and the\nheadquarters is completely equipped, it\nwill be possible to expand the schedule to\nas much as 500 hours of programming per\nyear. A constant search is carried on to\nfind new sources of meaningful program\nmaterial.\nA stimulating prospect for the future is\nexemplified by the recent grant to the\nNAEB by the Adult Education Fund of the\nFord Foundation, for the purpose of pro¬\nducing four series of programs. On a\nscale hitherto impossible, people with ex¬\ntensive experience in both education and\nbroadcasting will have the opportunity to\nbring together outstanding subject-matter\nexperts and the finest radio writers and\nproducers. The programs will be authori¬\ntative in content and as suitable to the\nmedium of radio as the best talent can\nmake them. They will be heard on the\nNAEB Tape Network.\nIn time for the second semester of the\n1951-52 school year, the network will be¬\ngin the distribution of programs specifically\ndesigned for in-school listening. The wide\nuse of radio for classroom instruction indi¬\ncates that this undertaking will be a major\nstep forward in the network’s service.\nThe National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters is hopeful that its network\nwill continue to grow and enlarge its posi¬\ntion as the chief source, in the United\nStates, of mature, intelligent, and provoca¬\ntive radio programs."
