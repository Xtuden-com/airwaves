  "text": "of Education Script and Exchange Service, from governmental agencies, from\ncommercial stations and networks, from the radio transcription services of\nforeign countries such as the French Broadcasting System of North America.\nCommunity resources should be explored for aids in programming. Some of the\ngroups which may be able to contribute a rich program service include little\ntheatre groups, university faculty and students, musical organizations, social\nservice agencies, medical and bar associations, service clubs, governmental\nunits, museums, libraries, safety organizations, and newspapers.\nPrograms originated by the school system can be tailored to the exact needs\nof the schools. The problems posed by them in writing and producing are\ntreated more fully under Production. At the programming level, the decision\nmust be made as to whether to broadcast them live (and recording for rebroad¬\ncast from the air) or to record them before broadcasting. Live broadcasts\nrequiring rehearsal at the studios may tie up studio facilities and when that\nis true, transcribed programs must be scheduled during the rehearsal period.\nPre-recorded programs offer no broadcast problem, although they may intro¬\nduce other problems such as assembling casts at periods other than the\nbroadcast day if equipment and staff are limited.\nAll programs designed for school use besides filling an educational need\nshould be selected with these criteria in mind:\n1. Do they help the teacher to be more effective?\n2. Do they have a rational plan and purpose?\n3. Do they advance the learning process progressively?\n4. Do they possess some degree of continuity?\n5. Do they pose problems and indicate techniques of solution?"
