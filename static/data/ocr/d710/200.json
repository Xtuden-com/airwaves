Evaluation Procedures Imperative\nResearch shows that some system of continuous evaluation of the school program\nis necessary to determine to what extent the educational aims and objectives\nof the school system are being realized. Radio and television should be\nsubject to, and participate in, the same continuous process of evaluation,\nfor it is not sufficient for the teacher to select broadcasts for school use\nsimply because their expressed aims and objectives seem to coincide with those\nof other prescribed learning experiences for a particular group of children.\nThe radio and television broadcaster needs to know positively whether the de¬\nsired educational changes are taking place and whether the full potentials of\nhis programs are being realized. Only through the continuing use of evaluation\ncan educational tools be re-shaped and sharpened to serve their purposes.\nInstruments of evaluation can be constructed by station personnel in coopera¬\ntion with general curriculum consultants, in the light of aims and objectives.\nBen Bloom, Examiner's Office, University of Chicago, suggests the following\nsteps:\n1.
