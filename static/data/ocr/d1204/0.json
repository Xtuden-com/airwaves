On the drawing board—plans to pro¬\nduce a special Trans-Atlantic Forum pro¬\ngram, originating simultaneously from\nWingspread, Washington, D. C., and Lon¬\ndon, featuring prominent figures. This and\nthe plenary sessions will be broadcast over\nWisconsin State Radio network, made\navailable live to other NER Wisconsin and\nMichigan stations.\nTwo of the major addresses will be de¬\nlivered by Charles A. Siepmann, professor\nof communications, New York University;\nRobert Lewis Shayon, radio-television crit¬\nic, Saturday Review.\nIn addition to leading educators in at¬\ntendance, these organizations will be repre¬\nsented : RCA; Zerox Corporation; West-\ninghouse Broadcasting Company; AFL-\nCIO; U. S. Commission for UNESCO;\nNational Council of Churches; General\nElectric Corporation; HEW; Office of\nEconomic Opportunity; National Endow¬\nment for the Arts, Humanities; FCC.\nAlabama Network Aids Schools\nJefferson County, Decatur City and\nHuntsville public schools began closed-cir¬\ncuit telecasts this month. Albania network\nstaff, under direction of A1 Renfro, engi¬\nneering and technical supervisor, were re¬\nsponsible for research and development.\nThey will continue to serve as consultants.\nHuntsville public schools are originating\ntelecasts from station WHIQ, a new pro¬\nduction center. Alabama network will use\nsome of the local programs.\nCONVENTION NOTE\nThe University of Missouri, Office of\nInstructional Television, will interview pro¬\nduction people at the NAEB October Con¬\nvention, as part of an ongoing research proj¬\nect on the use of audio-visual materials in\nITV. Contact Barry J. Cronin or Dr. Bar¬\nton L. Griffith in advance or at Muehle-\nbach Hotel.\nFord Proposal Stirs Hill\nThe Ford Foundation’s proposal for de¬\nveloping and financing ETV has brought\npositive action from the House and Sen¬\nate. Last month, Sen. Pastore (D-R.I.),\nchairman of Commerce Communications\nSubcommittee, began hearings. Sen. Mag-\nnuson (D-Wash.), father of $50 million\nETV aid, intrigued with the FF approach\nbecause “ETV stations have no firm finan¬\ncial base on which to operate,” wants to\nknow how government can assist.\nRep. Pepper (D-Fla.) introduced HR-\n16909, which would extend facilities pro¬\ngram five years, raise per-state ceiling from\n$1 million to $3 million.\nNAEB Board chairman Richard B. Hull\ntold Sen. Pastore that Ford is offering “a\nnational educational TV system, and funds\nto make it wiork—twin bright promises.”\nNAEB president William Harley said\nthat “educational radio is no less a vital\nconcern . . . has never materialized its po¬\ntential for fully serving education and the\nNation.” He urged that educational radio\nbe included in the Committee’s considera¬\ntion of interconnection and financial sup¬\nport for a “second service” for broadcast¬\ning.\nSenate check into who should own and\noperate a domestic-satellite communications\nsystems stems from an American Broad¬\ncasting Co. aim to put up its own satellite,\ndistributing programs to affiliates. FCC re¬\nturned the ABC application early this year,\nthen began full-scale inquiry on legal, tech¬\nnical and policy issues involved.\nABC, National Broadcasting Co., Com¬\nmunications Satellite Corporation (Com¬\nsat) and Ford Foundation submitted “mod¬\nels” of satellite systems. Only ABC and\nFord provided for ETV; ABC allotted one\nchannel, Ford suggested revolutionary ex¬\npansion.\nFF President McGeorge Bundy proposed\na nonprofit corporation to handle a domes¬\ntic satellite system for commercial television,\nallot “profits” to ETV. Capital cost for 4\nregional ETV centers, $50 million; annual\nETV expenses $60 million. One-third of\nITV costs “might come from new appro¬\npriations,” probably the government. A por¬\ntion of the estimated $45 million savings in\nland-line charges per year to networks would\ngo for ETV programing. FF would spend\n$30 million a year, up to $60 million within\nten years.\nRECENT FCC FILINGS\nInstructional Television Fixed Service:\nAugust decision by FCC says: Appli¬\ncation for more than one ITFS chan¬\nnel must include information about begin¬\nning and completion of construction of each\nchannel applied for. If fewer than four\nchannels are sought, it is now permissible\nto request that remaining channels in the\ngroup be reserved.\nFederal Communications Commission\nturned down application from The Board\nof Regents of the University of the State\nof New York for advance information on\napplicants for ITV Fixed Service. Regents\nwanted states to do the screening.\nIn written statement: NAEB asked FCC\nto reject petition from Television Broadcast\nStations, Salina and Lincoln Center, Kan¬\nsas. TBC wants Channel 34 substituted for\nChannel 9; and Channel 9, now at Lincoln\nCenter, moved to Salina for commercial\npurposes.\nNAEB said switch would hamper de¬\nvelopment of Channel 8, Hutchinson ETV,\nplanned to serve more than 700,000 Kan¬\nsans. In addition, costs involved in operat¬\ning Channel 34 at Lincoln Center as pro¬\nposed by TBC would be prohibitive for\nETV interests.\nNAEB has urged FCC to take prompt ac¬\ntion in licensing Nebraska Educational Tele¬\nvision Commission to activate Channel 19,\nNorfolk, Nebraska—would provide broad\ncoverage for northeast part of the state.\n(RM-998)\nLane Community College, Eugene, Ore¬\ngon, has filed application for a permit to\nbuild a new ETV station.\nNEA-OE Seeks New TV Data\nThe National Education Association, in\ncooperation with the U. S. Office of Edu¬\ncation will query approximately 90 percent\nof all educational institutions to determine\nhow many schools are using closed-circuit\nor Instructional Television Fixed Service\nand specific use of facilities.\nSchools using CCTV and/or ITFS sys¬\ntems will be asked for detailed information\non personnel and equipment, to aid USOE\nin making recommendations for equipment\ncompatibility.\n1"
