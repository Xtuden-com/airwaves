The building also provides space for film pre¬\nview, an art room, darkroom, combination dressing\nand rest rooms, a program director’s office and a 280\nsquare foot general office.\nThe building is constructed of Armco galvanized\nsteel. It is fully insulated and temperature is main¬\ntained between 70 and 73 degrees throughout the year\nby a Westinghouse heat pump system. These pumps\ndraw heat from the outside air even in winter and pro¬\nvide cool air in the summer. The two five ton units\nemployed are installed in outdoor metal bins.\nThe $25,000 is all inclusive and covers studio fix¬\ntures, (except TV lighting system) flooring, wiring\nducts, toilets, conduits, air pumps and a ball bearing\nsliding door. At a little over $11 a square foot, this is\nvery reasonable building cost. Construction was be¬\ngun on July 15 and the first TV program went on the\nair from the studio on December 15.\n* * *\nThose of you who watched the inauguration Jan¬\nuary 21st were privileged to see some of the first\nnetwork use of Ampex videotape recording for de¬\nlayed broadcast. Both CBS and NBC taped the oath\ntaking ceremony. CBS replayed it twice at approxi¬\nmately 30 minute intervals after the actual ceremony.\nNBC also reported that it played back a tape of the\nceremony less than a half hour after it had occurred.\nThe use of magnetic video tape recordings is\ngradually increasing on the networks. December 24\nCBS began using videotape for the West Coast re¬\npeats of the Arthur Godfrey “Talent Scouts” program\non Mondays at 8:30 p. m. EST. Beginning in March\nwhen Godfrey is on vacation, the program will be pre\nrecorded and played back for both East and West\nCoast broadcasts.\nNBC is now making use of videotape for West\nCoast repeats of five Monday-Friday program series.\nBeginning January 22, NBC will present the “Truth\nor Consequences” program (11:30 a. m. - 12 noon\nEST) on tape. The program will be recorded at a\n6 p.m. PST, audience performance and repeated on\ntape the following day in both East and West.\nAmpex officials have also announced they are in¬\ncorporating six new features in the production models\nof the videotape recorders as a result of the experi¬\nence gained by CBS and NBC in their use of the pro\ntotype models. Delivery on the production models is\nnow set for November, 1957, nine months later than\nthe anticipated start of delivery at the time of the\ninitial demonstration of the machine last April.\nThese new features are: adequate cueing facil¬\nities, convenient switching devices, ready syn\nchronization with other studio apparatus, tape inter\nchangeability among recorders, ease in making du¬\nplicate copies of taped programs and easy editing.\nWhile all of the above features are of interest tc\nETV engineers, this is the first mention that Ampex\nhas made of “duplication” of videotape recordings\nOfficials of the Ampex Corporation have been very\nconservative in their statements regarding their\nvideotape recorder. They now forsee three steps in\nthe evolution of monochrome videotape: 1) Strictly\nfor delayed broadcast, 2) Prerecording of TV shows,\n3) Syndication and multiple release of taped pro\ngrams for TV.\nPlacement Supplement\nThe following are persons registered with us last month.\nAnyone wishing further information or wishing to register\nwith the NAEB Placement Service contact Mrs. Judith Stevens,\n14 Gregory Hall, Urbana, Illinois.\nFebruary I — Director of radio-TV at large university\nwants new ETV position in similar capacity.
