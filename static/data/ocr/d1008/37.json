The first of these had\nwide publicity and was very instrumental in the action of the\nFederal Communications Commission in setting aside channels\nfor educational use. The others in the series have served\nto show the changing pattern of TV programming as well as to\nstudy certain special aspects of specialized program treatment.\nA fourth monitoring study has now been authorized to be\nconducted throughout the week of January 3-10,\nWe are enclosing a statement of the general intent and scope\nof the 1954 study for your consideration. We should like to\nknow if you would be interested in conducting the study this\nyear under the same general plan as that followed in the\npreceding studies. We assume that you are familiar with\nthe earlier studies and their findings. Should you be\nwilling to undertake the study, will you let us have your\nestimate of the cost of the service, these costs to cover\nthe securing of data, evaluation and compilation of data and\nthe written project report ready for publication. Your costs\nshould not include actual printing and publication.\nSince we have had three previous studies we therefore have\na mood indication of probable costs for this one. If you\nare interested we would be glad to confer with you on\nestimates.\nWe would appreciate an early reply so that arrangements for\nthe study can be completed in sufficient time to get the\nactual monitoring done during the designated week'in January.\nVery truly yours,\nRJC:jm\nR. J. Coleman, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee"
