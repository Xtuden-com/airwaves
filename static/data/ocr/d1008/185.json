  "text": "7-7-7\nThe concensus of the group was that there is no longer any need for the NAEB\nto sponsor a basic production workshop like the first three since the demand for such\na service is practically gone.\nWinnie - Proposed committee consideration of the problem of raising the competence\nof the people working in specialized areas - those weak in specific areas, such as\nwriting and program development, lighting, and kinescope recording.\nGarrison - Whole area of staging needs improving.\nWinnie - Might be value in an advanced workshop specifically in production with\nreally Hop talentto lead it. Another area to be considered is graphics. The\nfilm area is one of increasing concern. Mist also consider integration of film in\nlive or kinescoped shows. Also slides and animation.\nGarrison - Workshops for these specialized areas should be of a shorter, more\nintense nature than our previous ones - probably five to seven days.\nWynn - ETRC is interested in this type of training and ew might be able to get\nsome fund3 there.\nMartin - One of the strongest needs the stations have is in the area of research.\nGeneral discussion of need for research training. Wynn reviewed the current ETRC\nplans for research into the effectiveness of ETV, wherein they will finance pilot\nstudies in eight different centers. It might be well for the NAEB Advisory Committee\nto the ETRC President to be more involved in this. Consensus of the group was that a\nstrong recommendation should be made to the Research Committee to reconsider holding\na research seminar.\nBidlack - (In answer to question from Winnie) Presumes that the Engineering\nCommattee would be interested in devoting considerable emphasis to lighting in the\nnext Engineering Workshop. Had some lighting in 1955 workshop, but no very successful\nresults.\nWinnie - Recommended that the lighting problem be referred to the Engineering ComÂ¬\nmittee for inclusion in their workshop."
