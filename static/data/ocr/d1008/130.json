This enables us to take\nthe most advanced knowledge on educational broadcasting directly\nto the small broadcasters and school systems.\n(k) We will have a more effective central office in a better position\nto serve educational broadcasters generally and to focus and\nunify the exciting activities now under wayo\n(5) We will have the opportunity for work groups and NAEB committees to\nmeet occasionally and restudy the problem before educational broad¬\ncasters and the proper functioning of the national organization and its\nprograms. Certain plans for this type of study are now under way. NAEB\nofficers will undoubtedly wish to talk to the Foundation in more detail\nabout this later,"
