Consensus seemed to be that\nif any more are done they should be done by the Research committee.\nGeneral discussion of surveys. Head and Martin asked if they wore to complete\nwork on their research project. It was agreed that Martin would finish it sometime\nin the spring. All the other projects now being done by committee members should\ndefinitely be completed.\nReporting workshops, seminars, etc. - Hill asked whether or not we should attempt\nto document future workshops and seminars as completely as we have in the past,\nespecially since quite a bit of the material is duplication. He suggested that an\neditor for all NAEB publications, including the Newsletter might be included in any\nproposed request for funds. Or the editing job might be included in any specific\nrequest for a workshop of which a report was wanted. A report shouldn8t be put out\nautomatically on every workshop and seminar held. Should be more selective. Probably\nsome, but certainly not complete, reporting of the workshop and seminars recommended\nin this meeting should be done.\nSkornia discussed the Newsletter problem which would be helped immeasurably if an\neditor were obtained.\nGarrison - Wouldn9t it be possible under the auspices of NAEB, plus DAVI, etc.,\nto hold an annual meeting, with outstanding people presenting outstanding papers, which\nmight be reflected in an “Annals?“ There are so few publications dealing with the pro¬\nfession seriously that something like this might be wise. General discussion with\nopinion being this might be a good idea.\nHead - APBE has as top priority project the publication of a journal for broad¬\ncasting.\nThe question was raised as to whether or not an attempt should be made to secure\nfunds for a full-time editor with broad responsibilities for publication of all NAEB"
