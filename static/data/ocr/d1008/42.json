I\nfeel that, since the decisions and contracts will be made by\nthe Board through Headquarters, there is no point in keeping\nthe bids and correspondence here. While I could not send you\nthe letters I have attempted to brief them in the letter so\nthat you will have the picture as it is.\nI am also enclosing a letter from H.H.Remmers regarding the\npossibility of adding Dr Benjamin Shimberg of the Educational\nTesting Service, Princetflm, New Jersey, to the membership of\nthe Research Committee. I am in accord with Dr. Remmers\nsuggestion because I feel that our committee cannot be too\nstrong in its professional makeup. I do raise one question,\nthat is in regard to membership bn committees by people who\nare not members of NAEB or whose agencies are not members.\nIt seems to me that we should not go far afield in taking in\npeople outside our NAEB organization interests and yet I do\nnot know what policies have been or or in that regard. You\ncan ready the correspondence and decide if you wish to appoint\nDr. Shimberg.\nI hope that our committee action is proceeding as you and the\nBoard would wish. Be sure that we will get our pther proposals\nas soon as we can get our committee together.\nSincere' ‘ ?s\nR.J .Coleman,Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\ncci H.H.Remmers"
