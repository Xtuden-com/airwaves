Seay\nKellogg Foundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Dr. Seay:\nIn answer to your telegram, X regret that we\nhave not yet been able to get an accounting for the\nmonth of June from the University of Illinois. As\nyou probably know, their fiscal year also closes as\nof June 30, and this apparently slows down preparation\nof accounts for June. This has happened each year in\nthe past, but the delay is even longer this year. We\nhave urged them to provide us with the necessary in*\nformation Just as soon as possible; when it is forthÂ¬\ncoming, we will prepare the annual financial report,\nand forward it to you immediately.\nThe annual program report is about completed and\nshould be ready shortly. This report has been delayed\nsomewhat this year by the fact that our operation is\nnow divided between Urbana and Washington. Because\nduplication of the report may take some time we will\nsend you a typed copy next week.\nThe proposed budget for 1961-62 is enclosed\nherewith, as well as a financial statement as of May\n31, 1961 (the most recent report available in view\nof the delay by the University of Illinois). You\nare aware, X am sure, that, with our expanded operation\nthe budget, which reflects the support of the W. K.\nKellogg Foundation, is supplemented by other funds we\nare able to get from our members in dues, from services\nprovided to other organizations, etc.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH :mem\nEnclosures"
