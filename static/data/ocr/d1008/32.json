Y.\nWHitehall 3-3600\nNovember 10, 1953\nDear Graydon:\nI have just seen the correspondence from FAE concerning the grant of\n$12, 500 for the Monitoring Study, of television programs in New\nCity during the week of January 3 to 10. I have also seen your reply\nto Miss Howard.\nBefore I go ahead with the preparation of the release let me invite your\nattention to the fact that any publicity on this particular kind of a grant\nwould put all of the stations in New York City on notice and there would\nbe a tendency to ho/i^up the programming during the test week. In the\npast we have always kept the availability of such funds, and for that\nmatter the exact time of measurement, completiy to ourselves. I think\nif an announcement were made publicly there would be atleast a dozen\nor two additional so called \"Educational” programs inserted into the\nprogramming of the seven stations for the week of January 3 to 10.\nLet me have your reaction to this without delay. If you want a release\nout I’ll be glad to prepare it and send it to Bill Griffiths in accordance\nwith your instructions but I would certainly bear in mind the possibilities\nof a skewed study, if the stations were aware of the measurements being\nSNS:bc"
