Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Dr* Seayt\nThere are a couple of things in the way of a report that I\nam happy to pass along to you*\nThe Board of Directors meeting in Columbus a week ago today\nauthorised submission of a proposal to the 1956 Convention that\nit approve increase of membership dues effective January 1, 1957*\nThis is another step forward.\nThe next item is more or less confidential although a lot\nof people know it. For some eighteen years or more there has been\nan Association for Education by Radio-Television* Present officers\nhave indicated their interest in joining that membership to NAEB\nand bring about the dissolution of the old AERT. Personally, I\nthink this will come to pass although we have many details to work\nout* This should not only strengthen NAEB but eliminate one more\norganization in the field. Both boards of directors have approved\nthe general conditions*\nSincerely yours.\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFESicu"
