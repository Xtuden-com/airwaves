We1re planning to administer the group and individual tests to small\ngroups of from 10-12 people in each,\nI hadn't planned to go into such great detail, but I thought you'd be\ninterested in knowing what I was actually doing.\nWe missed you at the Invitational Conference^ hope we can get together\nfor a long chat before long. Be sure to let me know when you plan to be in\nthe East.\nHenry Chauncey specifically asked to be remembered to you, and I know\nhe's pleased at the possibility that we may be able to work together on TV\nresearch, I hope you'll write soon and give me your ideas as to possible\nareas of cooperation.\nHelen sends regards.\nSincerely,\nBenjamin Shimberg\nAssistant to the President for\nEvaluation and Research in Educational Television\nBS:bc"
