Schooley, President\nNational Ass’n. of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nNo, you are not correct in your assumption -with respect to the\nsalary item in your budget. Approval is to be secured from us\nin advance for increases in specific salaries if those positions\nare listed in the proposal submitted to us, if the increases\nwere not specified in that proposal, and if funds for the in¬\ncreases are to be paid from our Foundation grant.\nWe should be making to you a payment for the first year of your\nnew program which is to receive Foundation support. I am wonder¬\ning how soon we will receive from you the program and financial\nreports for the past year. It is highly desirable to have these\nreports before we make the next payment.\nSincerely and with best wishes,\nMFS/fh\ncc - Mr. Harry J. Skornia\nMaurice F. Seay"
