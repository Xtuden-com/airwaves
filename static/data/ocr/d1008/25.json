Van DUYN\nASSOCIATE DIRECTOR\nWILL WIUG\nUNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS\nMr. Frank E. Schooley, President\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nAre we ever going to find enough time to do even a few of the\nmany things we would like to do? I was glad to have had the\nopportunity to say hello when we were recently in Columbus, but\nregret there was not more time to discuss several things with\nyou. As you know, I had not expected to be able to attend any\nof the meeting until the Foundation was notified that it had\nreceived the award. Then Dr. Morris asked if I would, for the\nFoundation and for him in particular, go down for the banquet.\nWe have all been traveling a lot, but we have not forgotten your\nTentative Research Proposal that is being*batted around here at\nthe present time. I hope you have not forgotten that we will\nneed soon to have your regular annual financial statement, a\nproposed budget for ye**** next year, and an annual report. These\nwe must have before we can make final payment of our commitment\nin July or August.\nIn case I don't write you again before I leave in a few days for\nthe Orient, may I wish for you and NAEB a very good year and say\nthat I look forward to seeing you all again upon my return to\nthe Foundation in the summer of 1956.\nKindest personal regards and best wishes to you all.\nSincerely,\nRobert VanDuyn\nRVD/dr"
