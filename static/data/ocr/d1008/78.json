Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nSiucational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\nIk Gregory Ball\nUrbana, Illinois\nThank you for letting us know that the 195^ monitoring study has\nnow been printed. We shall appreciate it '\nindividual copies of this study to the names and addresses on\nthe lists we are enclosing. It seems better for the distribution\nto be hand Led this way than for you to send the publication in\nbulk to us here. We shall be glad to reimburse you for the\npostage and any other expense which you may incur In sending\nthem out for us.\nThe copies to our Board members, to Messrs. Gaither, Berelson,\nMcDaniel, and Eurich, and to our grantees should be accompanied\nby the little slips, bearing Mr. Fletcher’s name, which we are\nenclosing. The ’’special request\" list and the youth organizations\nwill receive a letter from Pasadena stating that the monitoring\nstudies are being sent under separate cover.\nThe following list of magazines and newspapers represents those\nto which the previous Hew York study was seat fro® our New York\noffice:\nLadies Htaaa Journal\nWoman’s Home Companion\nThe New York Times\ntbe Hew York Herald Tribune\nThe Mew York Daily Mows\nThe World-Telegram and Sun\nIt seems to us that the monitoring study would more appropriately\nbe sent to these people directly by the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters instead of by the Fund. Will you please\ntherefore take care of this list in your own mailing.\nYou will note that we have included a list of our grantee organiza¬\ntions which we believe would be Interested in the study. If the\nNAEB, however, would prefer to send the publication to these"
