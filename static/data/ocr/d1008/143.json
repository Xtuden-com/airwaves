Most\nof that violence in a sinister context occurs in programs intended for the general\nadult audience.\nOnce again, there is little basis in this study for the formulation of\nvalue judgments about violence in TV. We have observed that there is much of it,\nand in this year’s study, we have found that not all of it is \"sinister\" in nature.\nBut we are in no position to say whether the value of the depiction of violence\nas a vicarious expression of aggression outweighs its possible danger as generator\nof behavior and attitude. Certainly, experimental study of this question is\nneeded.\nPublic Issues on TV. The relative amount of time devoted to public issues\nprograms has remained fairly constant over the four year span of the New York TV\nstudies. In 1954, 1»6% of total program time was devoted to public issues\nprograms. Table 2 shows how attention wad divided among the more frequent public\nissues on television as compared with the front pages of New York newspapers for\nthe same week. On television, slightly more than 14 per cent of the topics\ndiscussed dealt, with recession and the nation’s economy. The Bricker Amendment\nmade up another nine and one-half per cent of the topics, and communism and\ndefense spending each accounted for another six and one third per cent.\nIn newspapers, the Berlin Conference garnered the most attention, taking up\nmore than 20 percent of the public issues topics reported on front pages, as\ncompared with only 4.8 per cent on TV. The American soldiers who refused\nrepatriation made up another 10.7 per cent of front page articles, but received\nmuch less attention on TV. About equal proportions of mention of the Bricker\nAmendment were found in newspapers and television. Labor disputes on railroads\nand subways received proportionally more consideration in newspapers than on TV,\nTable 3 shows how the monitors of public issues programs rated the discu¬\nssions on three different dimensions. For the most part, public issues dis¬\ncussions were found to use mostly rational appeals, to present usually one view¬\npoint, but to be relatively impartial in their presentations.\nAdvertising on New York TV. The proportion of total program time devoted\nto primary advertisements rose 3*4 per cent over 1953 to a total of 13.4 per cent\nfor 1954. As we stated earlier, a portion of this gain is due to greater accuracy\nin monitoring proceduresj unfortunately, it is impossible to say how much of the\ntrend can be so explained.\n(6)"
