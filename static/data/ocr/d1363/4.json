  "text": "This contemplated program will require both state-wide netÂ¬\nworks and individual stations operated by local educational institutions.\nTherefore, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters endorses\nthe recommendations of the United States Office of Education for a total\nof fifteen channels for non-commercial educational broadcasting. In\norder to operate state-wide networks so that rural areas may be adequate\nly served, the power restriction of 1,000 watts for educational stations\nshould be removed. It is difficult to see why such a limitation was\nwritten into the rules in the first place. There is no reason why the\ntechnical facilities for educational broadcast stations should be\ntreated on a basis different from that .applying to broadcasting in\ngeneral. It is the position of our Association that recognized\neducational institutions, or any other applicant with a definite\neducational purpose in mind, should have the maximum opportunity to\nserve the greatest area and the greatest number of people consistent\nwith the recognized nurposes of the individual applicant.\nEducational broadcasting wishes to take full advantage of the\nhigh quality offered in the present system of FM transmission and,\ntherefore, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters endorses\nthe technical recommendations of HTPB panel 5 for 200 kilocycle channels.\nFACSIMILE AND TELEVISION:\nIt has long been established that combined audio-visual aids\nare much more effective than either separately. Therefore, the place\nof educational broadcasting in facsimile and television is unquestioned.\nPractically the entire lecture-teaching process is embodied in such a\nsystem.\n- 5 -"
