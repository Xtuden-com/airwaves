We have not written material\nabout the educational associate membership since it was set\nup as a category for such national organizations as NEA, the\nLeague of Women Voters, ASCD, etc., and as a \"stop-gap” cate¬\ngory for eduoatlonal institutions in the early stages of\nplanning a broadcast or closed-circuit operation. Actually,\nthis category is not even specifically provided for in the\nBy-Laws, and we have not \"pushed\" membership in it; therefore,\nwe have not printed materials relative to this catagory.\nI am sure you realize that Memphis State University will have\nto transfer to one of the four major catagorles when it actually\nbegins to operate either a closed-circuit or broadcast facility\nor produces programs of an instructional or cultural nature on\na regular basis for transmission over some other outlet. In\nfact, if you are regularly producing programs for WKNO, you would\nnot be eligible for educational associate membership.\nHo application form is necessary for you to join. All we need\nis a letter from you stating your Interest in joining and out¬\nlining your plans for the future in the educational broadcasting\nfield. We may either send along a check for $35 for 1965 dues,\nor we will be happy to bill you.\nI am asking our Research A Development office to answer your\nquestions about the establishment of closed-circuit television\non your campus. 1 am sure you will hear from them in the near\nfuture.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill"
