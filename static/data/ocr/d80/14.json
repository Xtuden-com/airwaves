Harley\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nWashington, D,C,\nDear Bill,\nI am sure that you will be interested to know how\nwe are getting along. Here is a brief note.\n(a) We have selected the site for the studio centre\n(r^ear Tel Aviv) and the site for the transmitter\n(near Jerusalem);\n(b) the architect has completed his preliminary plans\nof the studio centre;\n(c) on the 26th September, we sent out invitations for\ntenders to seven firms in the United States, United\nKingdom, France and Germany. We expect to receive\ntheir tenders by 7th November, 1963;\n(d) after the decision on the tenders, we shall be\nable to complete the architectural plans (the\nsuccessful tenderer will undoubtedly ask for a\nnumber of architectural changes and facilities).\nThereafter we shall be able to prepare, and issue,\nthe building tenders and, hopefully, begin construction\nin about March/April 1964.\n(e) we have engaged some senior staff, the administration\ndirector and the education director. The other senior\nappointments, the production director and director of\nengineering will be made abroad and we hope to finalize\nthese in the not too distant future. Our education\nofficer. Dr. P. Blumenthal, will probably go on a\nstudy tour (arranged by UNESCO) early in 1964. I shall\nwrite to you about his visit to the United States\nin due course, if I may."
