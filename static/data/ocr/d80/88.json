Altschuler\nPresident\nFilm Cartridge Productions, Inc.\n113 North San Vicente Boulevard\nBeverly Hills, California 90211\nDear Mr. Altschulers\nI am sorry for the delay in answering your recent letter,\nbut as my secretary informed you, I have been on the road\nquite a bit recently.\nThere are two ways in which commercial concerns can affiliate\nwith the NAEB. Those engaged in the manufacture and/or sale\nof broadcast, or broadcast affiliated, ecruipraent may become\nIndustrial Associates. In this category we have such firms\nas Ampex, RCA, GE, 3M, and numerous others.\nHowever, I am guessing that your firm is not actually eligible\nfor this category, therefore you can become Sustaining\nAssociates. This category is open to any industrial concern\ninterested in furthering educational broadcasting through\ncooperation with the NAEB. Dues are $200 annually.\nSustaining Members receive copies of our bi-monthly journal\n(a professional journal in the field of educational broadÂ¬\ncasting), the monthly Newsletter, miscellaneous reports of\nseminars and research activities, and other materials we\nrelease from time to time. Under separate cover I am sending\nyou a sampling of these materials.\nIn addition, of course, affiliation with the NAEB provides alt\nindustrial firm an opportunity to mingle with educational\nbroadcasters as \"one of the family\" at our annual convention,\nour regional meetings and other seminars we hold from time\nto time. I suppose you might also say such affiliation"
