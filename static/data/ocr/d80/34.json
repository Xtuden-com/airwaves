  "text": "Mr. Irving Kahn\n-2-\nJuly 30, 1964\nA brief summary of these bendflts would include: multiple copies of our\nperiodicals as well as the various reports we publish from time to time;\nspecial rates for advertising in some of our publications; listing in our\nmembership Directory; and, perhaps most important, becoming â€œpart of\nthe family** at our Regional and National meetings, thus permitting more\ninformal and intimate conversations with our members. Representatives\nof our Sustaining Associates are also invited to attend most of our seminars\nand workships and thus meet with NAEB members on a very informal basis.\nIn addition, although we do not attempt to persuade our members to patronize\nour Sustaining and Industrial Associates in preference to other concerns,\nit is only reasonable to presume that educational broadcasters, often\nstruggling on minimum budgets, would prefer to give their business to\nthose commercial concerns which have evinced a sincere interest in the\nwelfare and furtherance of educational broadcasting.\nWe hope that you will consider affiliating with us in the educational\nbroadcasting movement. If you have further questions, please do not\nhesitate to get in touch with me.\nSincerely,\nWGHrmab\nHEH;mab\nWilliam G. Harley"
