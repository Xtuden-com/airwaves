Industrial Associates also are considered \"part\nof the family\" at our Regional Meetings and annual conventions and\nthus are able to chat more intimately with our members. Representatives\nof our Industrial Associates are invited to attend mostOof our seminars\nand workshops and thus meet with NAEB members on a very informal basis.\nI hope that it will be our privilege to welcome Hoffmann-la Roche to\nour Association as an Industrial Associate. Ihere is no membership\napplication to complete for this category of membership. All weeneed\nfrom you is a letter stating your intention of Joining. We will bill\nyou as you wish, or you can send your membership fee along with your\nletter*\nSincerely,\nHoc*\nSandra Olson\nMambership Associate"
