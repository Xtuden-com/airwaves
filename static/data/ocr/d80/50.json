Although this intangible benefit of membership is not really very\nimportant to your business, you should know that, although we do not attempt\nto persuade our members to patronise our Sustaining Members in preference\nto other concerns, it is only reasonable to persume that educational broadÂ¬\ncasters, often struggling on minimum budgets, would prefer to give their\nbusiness to those organizations which have evinced a sincere interest in the\nwelfare and furtherance of educational broadcasting. Membership in this\nAssociation would also entitle you to attend our Regional meetings and annual\nConventions and thus be able to chat more intimately with our members.\nRepresentatives of our Sustaining members are invited to attend most of our\nseminars and workshops and thus meet with NAEB members cm a very informal\nbasis.\nI hope it will be our privilege to welcome International Correspondence\nSchools into our Association. If you have further questions, please do not\nhesitate to get in touch with me.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. HOI\nHEH:kk\ncc: Mr. Jack Summerfield"
