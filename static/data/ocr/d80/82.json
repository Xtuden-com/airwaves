Dolan\nATIT-SCH-EV\nDSOONARC\nFort Monroe, Virginia 23351\nDear Tom:\nBelieve it or not, we now have an \"official home\" for military\nmembers!\nAt its meeting last wefck in Columbus, Ohio, the NAEB Board of\nDirectors approved the establishment of a Military Associate\ncategory, with annual dues of $35. Any, like Joe Jordan,\nwho might have joined the Association as Educational Associates\nwill not automatically be transfered over to the new category\nof membership by Mrs. Templeton.\nWe will soon begin to undertake a \"membership drive\" for military\nmembers and will appreciate any help you or your compatriots can\ngive us. Once we have several members in this category, there\nis no reason why the group could not elect a chairman and/or\na steering committee to serve as liaison to the HAEB staff and\nboard.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/mlm\ncc? Joseph T. Jordan, Jr.\nMrs. Dorothy Templeton"
