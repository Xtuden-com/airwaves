Those engaged in the manufacture, distribution, or sales of\nbroadcast and related equipment and supplies may become Industrial\nAssociates, while other business firms, without such specific involvement\nin broadcast equipment, may become Sustaining Associates. I believe,\nfrom your letter, that Acme Film Laboratories, Inc., fits into the latter\ncategory.\nThe NAEB is the only professional and trade association serving the field\nof educational broadcasting. Our members represent more than four\nhundred educational radio and television stations, production centers, and\nclosed circuit installations; more than 1500 individual members who are\nengaged in or seeking to promote educational, cultural, and public service\nbroadcasting; and over one hundred schools, universities, associations,\ncommercial stations, and industrial firms who are a part of the expansion\nand development of education via the broadcast media. I am enclosing a\nbooklet which will tell you more about the aims and activities of the\nAssociation. Also enclosed are copies of some of our publications.\nAs a Sustaining Associate, your company would be joining such firms as\ncommercial stations. National Community Television Association, the\nEducational Radio Network, the National Audience Board, and the\nNational Broadcasting Company.\nOur Sustaining Associates, as a contribution to the national educational\nbroadcasting movement, pay dues of $200 annually. Industrial Associates\npay $500 annually. Sustaining and Industrial Associates also receive\ncertain tangible benefits in return for these dues."
