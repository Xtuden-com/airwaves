This means that it is probable that specific qualifications and dues\nwill not be established for another 60 to 90 days.\nIn the meantime, if you are interested in membership we would be happy to\nodd your name to our mailing list to receive our materials regularly. As\nan Associate member you would be entitled to receive our bi-monthly Journal,\nmonthly Newsletter, Washington R ports, and all other materials which the\nNAEB distributes from time to time, Ihen as soon as the new board of\nDirectors makes the necessary decisions, we win notify you as to which\ncategory we believe you belong in, and at that time indicate what you\ndues will be. You will then be able to determine whether you feel that\nthe services to be offered will be sufficient to warrant the dues you\nwill be asked to pay.\nWe hope to hear from you soon.\nSincerely,\nHKBssc\nHarold E. Hill\nVice President"
