You can\nimagine that every step presents its own problems but I hope\nthat we shall solve them one by one.\nSoon we shall face the question of engaging junior\nstaff and setting up our own research team from the very beginning.\nThere will still be plenty of excitement, frustration and exÂ¬\nhilaration before we shall send out our first telecast.\nWe have formed a special company, as you will see from\nthe notepaper. Let us call it, for short, I.T.T. The Board of\nthe Company consists of\nLord Rothschild, Chairman\nMr. R. Gottlieb\nMr. M. Rowe\nWe would like I.T.T. to become a member of your NAEB.\nWe discussed this with you at the time and you indicated that this\nwould be possible. Could you kindly let us have whatever forms\nare necessary for the official application.\nI hope that you are keeping well.\nKind regards.\nYours sincerely,\nM, Rowe"
