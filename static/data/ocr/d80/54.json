C. 20036\nDear Mr. Hills\nWhen I buttonholed you once in Austin at the Convention,\nyou suggested I write you about Memphis State University be¬\ncoming affiliated with NAEB. As I look over the requirements\nfor the various divisions, I believe our University would\nqualify as an Educational Associate. Would you, therefore,\nplease send me whatever information and forms necessary so\nthat I can make my presentation.\nAlso, I would appreciate any help you and yours could\ngive me on the ways and means for beginning a closed-circuit\ntelevision operation on our campus. I would like to have\nliterature on various systems, as well as on the kinds of\norganization and operation for such a facility. In addition,\nI am most anxious to find out what financial help we can get\n— and from whom — on the purchase of equipment.\n, As you might gather from my requests, television is\ni^bout to sprout at Memphis State. And, accordingly, I am\nvery grateful for your organization and would greatly appre¬\nciate your aid and comfort. Best wishes.\nSincerely,\nD<\nRadio and Television"
