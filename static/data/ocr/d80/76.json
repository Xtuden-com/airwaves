Hill\nVice President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n13lj6 Connecticut Avenue\nWashington, D. C, 20036\nDear Harold:\nI am in receipt of your recommendations and comments, and I appre¬\nciate your help in this matter. I will sit down and outline more\nspecific requirements for the present and get back to you as soon as\nI can.\nI am using this letter for two purposes. One is to let you know\nthat I received the above noted letter, and secondly to send you some\nadditional information reference NAEB membership for military organi¬\nzations. This serves as a follow-up to my letter to Bill Harley on\ni* March, and your reply on 16 March. It seems as though your Member\nRelations Director, Mrs. Tenpleton, has resolved the problem with an\nEducational Associate Membership (see attached copy of her letter).\nThe answer provided seems to fill the bill for military memberships\nboth price-wise and responsibility-wise. We would not be able to vote\nor participate to the same degree as other institutional members, which\nas a military installation we cannot do anyway; therefore this could be\nthe very answer we have been looking for.\nIf the Educational Associate seems to solve the problem as far as\nyou are concerned, I would be able to give you a list of contacts who\ncan act on this type membership.\nAs planning develops here on our study, I will be in touch with\nyou again.\nSincerely,"
