NEW JERSEY 07703\nsig ;\n1 March 1965\nMr. Thomas Dolan\nATIT-SCH PP&P (P&R)\nUSCONARC\nFort Monroe, Va. 23351\nDear Tom,\nThe question of membership in the NAEB has come up\nagain. In discussing this with Major Colville and later briefing\nGeneral Brown as to what the situation was, I wonder whether or\nnot it wouldn't be possible for you to suggest a CONARC memberÂ¬\nship in the NAEB with the understanding that all CONARC schools\ncould participate to the extent that this would seem desirable.\nWe discontinued our school membership last year because of\nthe increase in dues. We are encouraging two people to take out\nindividual memberships. The idea of having a CONARC membership\nthough, if it were possible, would insure that all schools would have\nthis organization as a source of information in the use of TV for\neducation and training purposes.\nSincerely,\nNEIL G. SMITH\nEducation Coordinator, USASCS"
