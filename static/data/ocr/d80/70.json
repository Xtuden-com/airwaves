This, of course, has to be one of\nour considerations*\nWe have referred the matter to a special Membership Committee\nwhich has been appointed by the NAEB Board* They are, at\npresent, deciding what feasible solution can be reached since\nthere are several military installations which have expressed\na desire to Join the NAEB. Naturally, we are most anxious to\nhave them eligible for membership*\nWe will contact you as soon as a decision has been made regard¬\ning a special category of membership* Me&nqhile, if you have\nany questions, please let us know*\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Mill\nml®"
