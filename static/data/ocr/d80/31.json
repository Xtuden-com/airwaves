This category of membership was established after\nthe reorganization when our Executive Committee realized that\nthe new NAEB structure had not really provided a \"home\" for\norganizations such as the Annenberg School which do not produce\nprggrams on a regular basis.\nThe services the Educational Associates receive are the same\nas they are for the institutional members. You will receive\ncopies of our monthly Newsletter, bi-monthly Journal, and\nsemi-monthly Washington Report Aim you will have an opportunity\nto attend workshops, seminars and our annual convention at which\nyou can swap information and knowledge with other educators from\nall over the world.\nWe hope that the Annenberg School will be able to continue its\nmembership in this new category.\nSincerely,\nmlm\n(Miss) Mary Lynn Moody\nSecretary to Harold Hill"
