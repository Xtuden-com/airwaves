In 1963, they\nequipped every one of their\n250 salesmen’s cars with\nAutostereo tape cartridge\nplayers.\nEach week, a tape car¬\ntridge was mailed from\nheadquarters bringing the\nmen in the field news of the\ncompany’s current promo¬\ntional program, new prod¬\nucts and general news of\ncompany activities.\nResults indicate the mo¬\nbile teaching machine will\nzoom in popularity in 1965.\nA number of companies\nhave contacted Jack Cum¬\nmings, sales director, Spe¬\ncial Products Division, Auto¬\nstereo Corp., Van Nuys, re¬\ngarding the use of the car\ntape players in company\ntraining programs.\nMany salesmen spend up\nto 40% of their time travel¬\ning between calls. This time\ncan be used to excellent ad¬\nvantage to learn more about\ncompany products, sales\nprograms, company policies\nand procedures.\nThe Autostereo player\nserves as an individual sta¬\ntion on a “tape network”\nwith programs designed to\ninform, entertain and edu¬\ncate.\nPercy H. Whiting, reporter,\neditor, sales manager and\nformer managing director of\nthe Dale Carnegie Sales\nCourses, offers information\non “The Five Great Problems\nof Salesmen and How to Solve\nThem” - a new book pub¬\nlished by McGraw Hill. Ac¬\ncording to Whiting, the five\ngreat problems of salesmen\nare:\n• They fail to organize their\nday’s work;\n• They don’t think creative¬\nly to solve their own or\ntheir customers’ prob¬\nlems;\n• They don’t know how to\nanswer objections;\n• They can’t motivate them¬\nselves;\n• They lack the ability to\ncommunicate effectively.\nA detailed method for sell¬\ning by recognition of and\nmastery over these prob\nlems is presented. Each\nproblem is described clear¬\nly with many of its ramifica¬\ntions, and the solution to\neach is presented in a\nstraightforward manner, re¬\nplete with anecdotes, dos\nand don’ts.\nRexall’s exploration with\nthe Autostereo tape player\nis an attempt to help sales¬\nmen solve these problems.\nIt obviously is not the only\ntechnique or method, but\nit does beam the company\nmessage directly to the in¬\ndividual at a time when he\ncan give his attention to\nthe message - while driv¬\ning from point to point.\nTo enhance the applica¬\ntion of this mobile teaching\nmachine, Ascon Manage¬\nment Corp. has developed a\nnew teaching technique-\nincluding use of the Auto¬\nstereo player in conjunction\nwith modern concepts of\npsychology and programmed\nlearning.\nTo all of this had been ad¬\nded entertainment produc¬\ntion values in each taped\nprogram designed to com¬\npete with the best programs\navailable on the auto radio.\nCalled “Autotrain,” the\nnew training system takes a\npage from Whiting’s book\nand builds from there."
