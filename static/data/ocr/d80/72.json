Dolan\nATIT-SCH-EV\nUSCONARC\nFort Monroe, Virginia 23351\nDear Mr* Dolan:\nBill Harley Mas asked me to reply to your letter of March\n4 regarding military membership in the NABB*\nWe are still working on this problem as explained in the\nattached copy of the letter to Neil Smith* Perhaps you and\nBill will have a chance to discuss this further at the\nRegion 11 meeting in Williamsburg the end of this week*\nAs 1 explained to you here in the office, it is extremely\ndifficult for us to Justify to our other members a special\nrate for military members; however, we are working on this\nand hope to have a report from our Board Committee in the near\nfuture.\nIt might be possible for USCONARC to join on behalf of its\nmember schools, but it would be difficult for ut to provide\nsufficient materials for distribution to all such schools*\nAs you probably know, definite plans have been made for holding\nthe Armed Forces Television Conference in conjunction with the\nNAEB convention this fall* We are working with Bob Wood and\nothers and hope that this can become an annual cooperative\nventure* We are acutely aware of the extremely valuable work\nbeing done in educational Television by the Armed Services,\nand we really do want to bring them into the membership* But,\nas I say, this delay is caused by the working out of details*\nSincerely,\nHarold S. Hill\nHEII/mlm\ncc: Neil Smith"
