  "text": "NAEB\nINSTRUCTIONAL DIVISION\nDues for the Instructional Division remain the same as they were last year,\nwith the amount based on the annual budget for your instructional activities\nthrough television and/or radio, as indicated in the table below. (The same\ncategories apply to all NAEB Divisions.)\nIt is recognized that among educational institutions and organizations there\nare no uniform accounting and budgeting practices. Appropriations budgets do\nnot always reflect the total cost of the operation. For example, most uni-\nversity and school system CCTV budgets would not include items for rent, heat,\nlight, maintenance, etc. Hence the figure you indicate for your budget should\ninclude actual expenditures plus equivalents, such as they enumerated, staff\nmembers paid by other departments, and other similar considerations. We do not\nintend to question budgets reported, and we have to rely completely on your\nintegrity in this matter. If there are any questions because of unusual or\nspecial situations, we will be glad to discuss with you what figures you should\nprobably report. Naturally, the figure you report will be confidential inÂ¬\nformation and will be treated as such.\nELease fill in the form below, and return this sheet to Washington Headquarters\nso that it arrives not later than November 20, 1964.\nOperating Budget\nAnnual Dues\nPlease check\nLess than $25,000 $100\n$25,000-99,999 200\n$100,000-249,999 300\n$250,000-499,999 400\n$500,000 and over 500\nOfficial Representative.\nInstitution_\nPosition_\nSpecial billing instructions."
