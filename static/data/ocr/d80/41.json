  "text": "GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING DUES\nA new billing procedure for NAEB dues and fees will be instituted this winter,\naccording to NAEB President William G. Harley. The new system is intended to\ncombine all NAEB dues and division fees into one sum, and, eventually, to shift\nthe billing period from the present calendar year basis to a fiscal year basis.\nAs a first step toward the latter goal, NAEB-ETS (Television Stations Division)\nmembers are being billed for NAEB dues and division fees for the six month\nperiod, January 1 - June 30, 1965* These members will then be billed for a\nfull year as of July 1, 19&5> thus putting them on a fiscal basis.\nMembers of NAEB-NER (Radio Division) and the Instructional Division are being\nbilled for the calendar year, January 1 - December 31* 1965; at this time but\nwill be billed for only half a year next winter, thus allowing them to begin\nfiscal year billing as of July 1, 1966. This will be especially beneficial\nto the members of the NER Radio Network who already pay their network fees\non a fiscal basis.\nThe changeover to the fiscal billing period is being made gradually to ease\nthe administrative problems involved.\nAs rapidly as possible the billing procedure will provide for billing each\nmember for all services in one sum, combining television, radio, and inÂ¬\nstructional billings (or such as are applicable). However, details will be\nprovided if requested by the member and billings will continue to be made for\nperiods other than a year if members desire to have the billing broken down\ninto more than one payment.\nAnyone with questions about their assessment should write to Harold Hill,\nNAEB Treasurer at the Washington office."
