Spencer\nLibrarian\nThe Arkansas State Teachers College\nConway, Arkansas\nDear Mr, Spencer:\n% believe that your library would qualify as an Bducatlonal\nAssociate of the NAEB, the dues for which are $35 per year.\nThis catagory is open only to institutions and organizations\nwith an interest in educational radio and television, but who\ndo not actually operate any radio and/or television facilities,\neither broadcast or closed-circuit, nor produce educational pro¬\ngrams on a regular basis for broadcast on any station.\nActually, it would be The Arkansas State Teachers College which\nwould be the member of the NAEB and not just your library since our\nmembership is open only to educational institutions and organiza¬\ntions.\nAs an Educational Associate you would regularly receive our\nJournal, Newsletter, Washington Report, and other publications\nwhich we issue from time to time. Ifyour institution decides\nto become an Educational Associate of the NAEB, a letter to that\neffect will suffice. The letter should include a brief description\nof your Interest and involvement in educational broadcasting, and\nshould designate a person to be the official representative of the\ninstitution in its relations with the NAEB. You may either enclose\nyour check for $35, or we can bill you.\nIf you have any fufcther questions, please do not hesitate to get\nin touch with me.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/mlm"
