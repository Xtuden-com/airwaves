Kraatz liked the\nidea, so Altshuler went to Dan Felger,\nwho had built Altshuler’s new home.\nWould Felger be interested in build¬\ning this Electronic Home for the\nHome Show?\nNot only would he be interested, he\nwanted to build one for himself as a\npermanent model home.\nThat left only the question of the\nequipment to be used. Some manufac¬\nturers of electronic gear offered their\nproducts for display without hesita¬\ntion; but the high fidelity industry in\ngeneral seemed to be dragging its\nfeet.\nNow Ed Altshuler is an old hi-fi\nman. Aside from writing for High\nFidelity TRADE NEWS in its early\ndays, he has been with such com¬\npanies as Benjamin nad Concertone.\nThe breakfast gave him a chance to\nmake his pitch (with a slide talk) to\nhigh fidelity manufacturers. Aside\nfrom Altshuler, Kraatz and Felger,\nthe most active participants in the\ndiscussion included Avery Yudin of\nBenjamin, Jules Rubin of Concertone,\nBill Thomas of J. B. Lansing, Bob\nBowman of Tandberg, and Ken Nel¬\nson and Lee Solomon of High Fidelity\nTRADE NEWS.\nEd Altshuler opened the discussion\nby asking for specific comments from\nthe manufacturers represented in the\ngroup on the display of their products\nin the Electronic Home.\nTom Jennings voiced what seemed\nto be an immediate objection to sev¬\neral of his colleagues: “There are three\nfinks in the chain by which systems\nwould get into homes in Southern\nCalifornia or similar markets—the\ndecorator, the architect, and the\nbuilder. Any one of these can disrupt\nthe chain, but none knows anything\nabout electronics.\n“Trying to reach the market this\nway, we are trying to slay the dragon\nfrom underneath his belly. The show\ncan sell the consumer—that’s the easy\njob. But you also have to sell the guy\nwho’s going to sell the consumer.”\n“That’s the advantage of the Elec¬\ntronic Home in the Home Show,” Ed\nreplied, “it shows the system in con¬\ntext.”\nAvery Yudin objected to the uni¬\nlateral decision by the builder what\nequipment would be used. “And once\nhe’s plut something in the wall, that’s\nit!”\n“First of all,” Ed countered, “we\nneed something to make it possible\nfor the consumer to get what he wants.\nSecond, we need to let the consumer\nknow that he shouldn’t settle for any¬\nthing but the best.”\nKen Nelson asked Dan Felger, as\na business .man and as a builder\nwhether he wouldn’t tend to look at\na product for its ability to jazz up the\nhouse, rather than as a specific brand\nthat is supposed to be good. And if\nit gets selected in terms of which\nwill deliver the most profit, shouldn’t\nit go out for bids?\n“I think you’re missing the point,”\nDan replied. “We will put in a house\nwhat is necessary to sell it in a given\nprice range. Obvoiusly, a man buying\na house for $20 thousand will demand\nless than the man buying a house for\n$30 or 40 thousand, and so on.\n“I wouldn’t know a hi-fi system from\na doorbell; but this is something you\nhave to sell to the consumer—not me.\nWhen people come knocking on our\ndoor, asking to buy a house in one of\nour developments, and they say, ‘I\nsaw such and such demonstrated at\nthe Home Show—can you put it on\nthis house?’ we can’t ignore it, at\nleast not if we’re getting 10 or 20\npeople out of 100 asking about it.”\nKarl Kraatz expanded on the way\nin which an exhibit in the Home Show\nputs an idea or a product directly be¬\nfore some 6,437 builders in the South¬\nern California area, to say nothing of\nthe national magazine coverage that\nis expected to result from the Elec¬\ntronic Home. To dealer objections\nthat shows are visited only by those\nwho are already sold, so that no in¬\ncrease in sales results, Kraatz replied\nthat that would be true only of reg¬\nular commercial exhibits. “Now we’re\ngoing to take that commercial exhibit\nand put it into a house, to show the\nconsumer what he can do and how to\ndo it.”\nTom Jennings felt that one incon¬\nsistency remained: “We have no dis¬\ntribution program through builders.\nAnd if you have a product that can’t\nbe properly distributed, you can for¬\nget the idea. That's why some of these\nhome intercom companies have been\nable to come in and do a big volume\n—because they had an outlet to go to:\nthe builder and the people who sell\nto builders.\n“Hi-Fi is oriented to specialists;\nand there is no method of coexistence\nin this business. The builder wants a\ngood markup, and I can’t blame him\n—he needs it. But the dealer needs a\nmarkup and they can’t both get it.\nThere’s not enough play with a prod¬\nuct that’s very expensive to begin\nwith.”\n“We’re going to go ahead,” said\nEd. “We’ll go to you as individual\nmanufacturers and say, ‘Are you in¬\nterested?’ We’re going to install an\nentertainment system, a communica¬\ntions system, controls, special devices,\nluminescent walls, devices to turn on\nthe sprinklers and close the windows,\na garage door opener, automatic fight\ncontrols—to build an all-electronic\nhome!\n“We’re going to say to the builders\nof America, ‘Just give us wire—wire\nand plugs.’ That’s all I want to put\nacross with Karl and with Danny.”\n“We’re not interested in being a\njobber or a wholesale outlet for your\ncomponents,” added Dan Felger.\n“Matter of fact, I don’t even want to\nbuy your components for the houses.\nYou’re going to sell these to the con¬\nsumers.”\nThe final question, voiced by Avery\nYudin, was: With several manufactur¬\ners in each category of hi-fi product,\nhow will you decide whose equipment\ngets displayed? First come, first\nserved, was Ed’s answer. If more than\none wants to participate for a given\ntype of unit, maybe a rotation system\ncould be worked out. But he pointed\nout that manufacturers like RCA and\nSylvania have been asking already.\nWhat the high fidelity industry doesn’t\nsupply, he implied, would have to\ncome from the communications com¬\npanies.\nLee Solomon, as publisher of High\nFidelity TRADE NEWS, closed the\nmeeting with our pledge not only to\nproduce printed matter to tie in with\nthe show, but to work for maximum\ndealer tiein—to let the dealer know\nwhat promotion he can build on and\nto let the consumer know who to go\nto to get the equipment he needs\nto make his an Electronic Home.\n22 HIGH FIDELITY TRADE NEWS\nAPRIL, 1965"
