You\nseem to be moving along with considerable dispatch.\nI will be pleased to meet with Dr. Blumenthal when he\ncomes to the United States and help him in his tour in\nany way I can.\nThe NAEB Constitution provides for the acceptance of\nmembership from foreign broadcasting agencies or\ninstallations engaged in educational broadcasting.\nThis is called an International Associate membership,\nfor which the dues are $250.00 per year. I am asking\nMiss Moody to send you details, application blank\netc. regarding this matter.\nGood luck to you and I.T.T.\nWith warm personal regards,\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHimab"
