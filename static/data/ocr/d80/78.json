Jansen (con't)\n-2-\nJune 2, 1965\nin preference to other concerns, it is only reasonable to presume\nthat educational broadcasters, often struggling on minimum budgets,\nwould prefer to give their business to those commercial concerns\nwhich have evinced a sincere interest in the welfare and furtherance\nof educational broadcasting. Industrial Associates also are conÂ¬\nsidered \"part of the family\" at our Regional Meetings and annual\nconventions and thus are able to chat more intimately with our\nmembers. Representatives of our Industrial Associates are invited\nto attend most of our seminars and workshops and thus meet with\nNAEB members on a very Informal basis.\nI hope that it will be our privilege to welcome/Ball Brothers,/to\nour Association as an Industrial Associate. There is no membership\napplication to complete for this category of membership. All we\nneed is a letter from you stating your intention of joining. We\nwill bill you as you wish, or you can send your membership fee along\nwith your letter.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to get\nin touch with us.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nmlm"
