The dues for\nInternational Affiliates are $250 annually. I assume that\nMr. Harley has already discussed the advantages of membership\nin the NAEB with you; however, please do not hesitate to get\nin touch with us if you would like more information.\nWe would consider it an honor to welcome Instructional Tele¬\nvision Trust as the newest International Affiliate of the\nNAEB, and look forward to hearing from you soon. Since there\nis no membership application needed for this category of member¬\nship, you will be placed on our membership list as soon as we\nget definite word from you that you wish to join.\nSincerely,\n(Miss) Mary Lynn Moody\nSecretary"
