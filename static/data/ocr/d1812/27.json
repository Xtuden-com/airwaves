This may influence\nall of your planning and programming, and take such activity out of the vacuum in\nwhich it must necessarily exist without such information.\nMember stations might do well to carefully examine individual program structures, and\nascertain just exactly how effective local programming is in reflecting and develop¬\ning the local homespun interests of your listeners.\nWhat measurements of program acceptance have you ever put down in a formal report?\nHave you considered doing a diary study or a series of personal interviews or tele¬\nphone interviews . . . or do you have a local program panel that you might use as a.\nguinea pig in deciding about programs before you present them? What about your own\npersonal experience, correspondence and research?\nIt cannot be emphasized too strongly that individual member stations must think in\nterms of obtaining audience information independently. Without this information it\nis extremely difficult to effectively promote or build audiences. It is the inten¬\ntion of NAEB to engage in agressive audience building activities. But this requires\ncomplete cooperation by individual member stations.\nDallas W. Smythe, our Director of Studies has many elaborate plans for fostering re¬\nsearch which will prove of great benefit to NAEB and to individual stations. It is\nan excellent suggestion to carefully read the research page of the News-Letter in\neach issue. If you have any comments, by all means address them direct to Smythe."
