  "text": "•17-\nFigure 3 represents a composite tonal reproduction curve of the curvature suffered\non the negative added to the curvature suffered on the positive. In comparing this\nparticular curve to similar curves obtained by using 7373-7302, or the 7302-7302\nmethod, it shows this curve to be considerably more linear in both black and white\nregions than either of the other methods.\nI am sure you can realize the distinct advantage of having a film stock such as this\nwhich is relatively fast and yet processes out with a very gentle toe and shoulder.\nAs can be seen by the printed sensi on Figure 3, there is very little black compres¬\nsion and very little white compression in the picture. When viewing these prints,\neither on a television system or by direct projection, there is certainly a greater\nphysiological advantage in the more faithful tonal reproduction characteristics of\nthis system as compared with other methods.\nObviously the kinescopes look more lifelike and faithful in their reproduction, and\nthey are; but they also look considerably sharper than those produced by other meth¬\nods, even through resolution charts exposed by both processes look very nearly alike.\nn\nrx"
