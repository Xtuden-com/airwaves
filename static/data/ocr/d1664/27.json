  "text": "WESTERN STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE\nsuch distempers as behaviorism and psychoanalysis and recover without\npermanent disfigurement must have a lusty constitution.” M-m-m.\nSounds like strong language! A stirring article on our national habit\nof “taking the name of psychology in vain” is found in The American\nScholar for the Summer Quarter. It is by Joseph Jastrow and raises\nthe question “Has Psychology Failed?”\nAre a few individuals in your school running all the student activi¬\nties, while all the others look on in boredom, if not in resentment? If\nso, you will find some helpful suggestions in “Uncliquing the Clique”,\nby J. C. Baker, in the October number of School Activities.\nWhen a college or university recruits its faculty chiefly from its\nown graduates, we call it “inbreeding”. The dangers of such a pro¬\ncedure is statistically revealed in an article by Walter Crosby Eells and\nAustin Carl Cleveland in the June Journal of Higher Education. Look\nfor it under the title, “The Effects of Inbreeding”.\n“Because teachers usually pay their bills and are considered good\nrisks, they are continually being invited to become customers of the loan-\nshark companies and many become regular and consistent victims.” A\nmethod of escape is described in “Credit Union for Teachers” by J. D.\nHull in the September Junior-Senior High School Clearing House.\nDo you sometimes get the dismayed feeling that the true aims of\neducation are becoming lost in a bewildering array of blanks, excuses,\npasses, circulars, bulletins, forms, rules, inventories, vouchers, receipts,\nand requisitions? Then you will enjoy a perusal of N. C. Kearney’s\n“School Size and Red Tape” in the issue of The Journal of Education\nfor September 16.\n-27-"
