Discussion on the needs for the future, in terms of financial support,\nwas held although no formal action was taken. This subject, too, may be\nplaced more formally before the 1956 convention.\nThere were two or three other places that your president got to during\nJune. On the first day of the month, he was returning from Houston where he\nassisted Dr. John Schwarzwalder in commemorating the third anniversary of\nKQHT-TV.\nIn the latter part of the month, he attended a meeting of the Joint Council\non Educational Television in Washington, and six days later was present for the\nspecial luncheon at which announcement of the first project using closed-\ncircuit television throughout an entire public school system was made. The\nluncheon was sponsored by the Hagerstown, Maryland, Chamber of Commerce and was\nheld in the Lincolnshire School of Hagerstown.\n-\nThere*s lots more to talk about if we just had time, but I imagine you*re\nbusy with your vacation, so I won*t bore you. Meantime, have fun. Have a\npleasant summer.\n•Rrank E. Schooley"
