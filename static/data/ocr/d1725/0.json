  "text": "NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTER3\nProposed Alms and Purposes\nIn appraising the work of the educational- stations we note\nthat marked progress has been achieved in recent years. Y/e are,\nhowever, aware of the great opportunity for future development\nwhich remains before us.\nThe greatest single obstacle confronting educational radio\nis the inadequacy of budgets—considering the magnitude of the\nservice which should be rendered. This is due in a large\nmeasure to the lack of a complete understanding of the needs and\nopportunities by those responsible for the determination of\nbudgets and policies. As these forces become aware of the public*\nappreciation of the service rendered we can expect increased\nfinancial support.\nWe, therefore, recognize the need for a more aggressive\nprogram for the development of greater support to the aims,\nobjectives and potentialities of educational stations.\nTo this end we recommend:\nI A wider use of available publicity media, to acquaint the\ngeneral public with the work, aims, and objectives of\nthe educational stations.\nA. Radio— Provide members with scripts telling the\nstory of radio and its educational potentialities.\nB. Press— That each member institution encourage and\nassist members of its staff, faculty, student body\nand contributing organizations to prepare news\nreports and magazine articles for publication."
