No successful\ncommercial station known to have operated very long,\nhas done so with poorly paid personnel. In many in¬\nstances, because of its very nature, educational\nprogramming is even more difficult to handle, and to\nallow students who have neither the educational back-\nbackground nor the technical experience, to make up the\nbulk of any staff is, in many cases, a blow to educa¬\ntional radio standards,.\nCommercial broadcasters have long delighted in\npointing out the low quality of production and writing\nof many educational programs. Unfortunately their\nbarbs are all too accurate. The truth hurts but the\nshoe fits, and we can’t deny their accusations.\nAs directors, we often must take a negative stand,\nagree with these people or feebly make some excuse.\nFew educational radio systems can look these people in\nthe e3^e and say \"We know you are wrong!\" The Abbots,\nEwbanks, McCartys, Paulus, Schooleys, and Siegels are\nindeed rare in this area of education.\nUntil deans, college presidents, comptrollers,\nand boards of education, can give Directors workable\nbudgets and fair share of the educational-pie, these\nsame Directors will be forced to compromise on staff\npostitions, programming policies, and educational\nstandards."
