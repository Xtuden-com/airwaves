We are given special allocations when needed. For\nexample, this year we asked for $50.00 to purchase small\nitems in connection with TV experimentation; it eras avail¬\nable. Last year we had a special allocation of $4,000.00\nfor two Collins consoles. We have just asked for space\nexpansion in the order of fifty per cent. It has beer\ned’and we have been asked to draw up plans for the conver¬\nsion of said space.\nWe use three speech staff members in radio. The practice\nof the department is a teaching: load of 12 hours per week\nwhore extra curricular activities are inv*lved. One of the\n3ta:xf members teaches 6 hours per week; trie other two teach\n9 hours per week. Thus, in strict accounting these reduc¬\ntions of teaching loads probably should be counted as\nsalaries. We have never attempted to figure our budgets in\nthis way. The only wages appearing on our budgets —xe re¬\npresented by the two A-2 items above.
