Funds are re¬\nceived from different sources, Including church, city,\nstate, and private resources. These budgets vary from\ntwo hundred dollars to three hundred, ten thousand\ndollars. In the Instance of the University of Oklahoma,\nthe budget for television Is as high as seven million\ndollars,’ In order to set up an educational television\nnetworko\nThe weakest division occurs in the Colleges and\nUniversities operating with 10 watts. The largest bud¬\nget in this particular division is still almost only\none half of the lowest average to be found in any of\nthe other three divisions. It Is interesting to note\nthat the average budget for Public Schools and Boards\nof Education Is almost nine times as great as_that for\nColleges and Universities with 10 watt operation.\nAlthough figures are not available as of this\ndate, certainlv a study should be made to see what pro¬\nportion of the individual Institution's pie-dollar\nis made available for each station. In order to obtain\na truer picture of educational broadcasting in this\ncountry, certainly such a study which would consider\nthe exact per-centages being spent in this area in re¬\nlation to other educational services from individual\norganizations, would be valuable.\nSince institutions in the first division average\nonly $3,367.00 for the coming budget year, it appears\nthat there may be a high disproportion, if one*considers\nthe size of other departmental staffs within the same\ninstitution."
