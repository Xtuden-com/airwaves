  "text": "CLEAR CHANNEL RESOLUTIONS\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters,\nassembled at Chicago September 17-18, 1945, resolved to submit\nto the Federal Communications Commission its position with\nrelation to the pending Clear Channel hearing.\nlo In its review of the evidence submitted at this\nhearing, the Commission is urged to consider the unique public\nservices rendered by the educational and non-profit radio stat¬\nions of the country.\nA study of the record of these stations must re¬\nveal the type of service which is not duplicated by any other\ngroup of stations in the United States. Their operation is truly\nin the public interest, convenience and necessity.\n2. The Association urges that the Commission seriously\nconsider the contention that the principle of public service must\nprevail over the traditional yardstick of the protection of un¬\nreasonable coverage.\n3. The resources of America*s leading educational\ninstitutions should be available to all. Yet the broadcast fac¬\nilities of these stations are at this time so limited in terms\nof power, frequency and hours of operation that only a portion of\nthe available service is being broadcast.\n4o Our members are ready and, because of years of\nbroadcast experience, are able to carry on an expanded radio service."
