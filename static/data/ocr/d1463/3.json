WNYC was the only\nstation to carry the complete proceedings of the UN’s most important meetings. This is the sort of job\nwhich fulfills the very highest functions of a radio station. Reckoned commercially, the cost would\nbe fabulous to even the largest networks and is further proof of the need and continuing usefulness of\na municipally-owned, non-commercial radio station.\nPublic and press response to the complete broadcasts were uniformly enthusiastic. For some spe¬\ncific examples of what both press and public thought, see later pages of this report.\n-2-"
