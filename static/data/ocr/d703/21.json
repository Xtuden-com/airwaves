C.\nDear Anns\nHere *8 as quick a reply as we can manage on yours of September 8. The\nitems mentioned on page 1 of your letter are all programs for which we\nhave no objection to your distribution for non-radio use.\nThe series listed as from Kent State University, OLD TALES AND NEW, is\nthe NAFB’s in-school series of 19^3* However the series we ran was from\nKUOM, the University of Minnesota, rather than from Kent State. Pending\nthis clarification, and subject to proper checking and credit, as well\nas origination permission, we would guess that we have no reason not to\ngive our blessing to this series as well. We are not familiar with\nPRENONS FRANCAIS, and don’t believe we have carried this.\nThe last three are series which will have to be negotiated for directly\nwith the originating institution, of course. We would hope that in each\ncase these are not new series which the institution contemplates offering\nto the Network. We are not familiar with any of them, and would think\nthat your non-radio use distribution would be justified.\nFinally, the CBC programs would also have our blessing, as far as I know.\nThe above comments result from consultation with John Holt, our Network\nManager.\nSincerely,\nHJS:cr\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
