  "text": "Dr. H. J. Skornia\nPage 3\nI am taking too much of your time, and probably the only way really to con¬\nsider the matter is by personal conversation. I intend to be at the Detroit\nmeeting of DATE. If you are there, I shall hope to be able to talk with you,\nand other NAEB persons who are interested in this matter. Essentially, DATE\nis a public school organization, in that NEA includes many more public school\nmembers than university or college. What goes on at the university level\nshould not be set as a pattern for the public school level, for the two are\ndistinctly different in organizational approach. If audio-visual materials\nare truly of value, they require enough supervision to demand a person who\ncan devote himself to that area, and not spread into many other areas. Even\nin our rather small system, the attempt to include all instructional materials\nunder one head would be ludicrous, and would simply mean the end of much em¬\nphasis on audio-visual. I simply can*t get done all the things I want to do\nin audio-visual. What if this were under one who had library service, various\nclassroom items such as maps and charts, and everything else the teacher may\nneed?\nIf I have been completely off the track in this letter, please let me know.\nIt was the result of some things I heard, and perhaps the reports were not\nentirely accurate, since the person who gave them is not familiar with the\nbackground of NAEB or its activities. \"Thanks for listening\"\nM. McCabe Day5 Director\nAudio-Tisual Center - Station WVSH"
