At the present time most impor¬\ntant college and university producers of educational broad¬\ncasts make their output available to the HASB Network. Some\nof these producers have also furnished tapes to the DAVI\nlibrary, but not many have done so. If these production\ncenters were made to understand that the MSB was districting\nfor broadcast and the DAVI-AERT library was distributing for\nnon-broadcast only, many more of the centers would offer pro¬\ngrams to both organizations.\nIf the HAS chose to agree to this exclusive-area\narrangement, the DAVI tape library might be able to obtain\nsome master tapes from NAKB. The HASH series would have\nbeen carefully screened originally and a great many would be\nespecially for classroom use. Such series would be an accessi¬\nble, pre-evaluated and, very important .addition to the DAVI\ntape catalog.\nI know that both the HASH and the DAVI are unselfishly\nconcerned with serving educational needs. It seems to me that\neducational needs in the areas of broadcasting and recordings\ncould be most efficiently served if duplication of effort could\nb© minimized through such a plan as I have suggested.. What do\nyou think of the idea?\nGale H. Adkins\nDirector\naRAiof\ncc. Dr. Many Skornia^-—N\nDr. Balph H. Hall"
