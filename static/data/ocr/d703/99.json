Hyer\nAssociate Executive Secretary\nDepartment of Audio-Visual Instruction\nNational Education Association\n1201-l6th Street, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nApril 18, 1957\nDear Miss Hyer:\nYou have shocked me with your letter of complaint concerning the\nwording of the AERT memorandum of last November 1. Certainly there\nwas no intent to slight DAVI. The reference to the sentence which has\ndispleased you \"No other organization seemed interested, etc.\" follow¬\ned a sentence referring to the situation as of five years ago. My in¬\nformation was that at that time (1951) there were no other organiza¬\ntions which had approached AERT with any indications of a merger. The\nreference in the memorandum was confined to that particular period.\nNo mention was made of the offer of DAVI to merge with AERT in 1956\nfor the intentional reason that such mention at this time could rather\nraise doubts which might be unwarranted.\nI wish that you had raised this point back in November of last\nyear after the memorandum was mailed. It is most difficult to deal\nwith the matter five months later and especially after the merger be¬\ntween AERT and NAEB has been effected.\nIt is unfortunate that you have called the memorandum \"an unfair\nslap at DAVI.\" This has not been the intention of anyone in official\nposition with AERT. On the contrary, some of us have maintained a very\nhigh regard for DAVI, and we were of the opinion that the feeling was\nmutual until your letter was received.\nSincerely,\nLeo Martin, Head\nRadio-Television Area\nLM:cs\ncc: Dr. Harry Skornia"
