One of the best I’ve heard or seen, old boy. We’re certainly with\nyou.\nCongratulations also on what sounds like a fine Convention. Our travel\nbudget no longer permits our \"attending\" conventions, unless we’re earmarked to\nplay a role commensurate with travel costs. You’ve all heard from me in past\nyears often enough so I’m glad to see new blood being involved, and I was\npretty \"snowed\" all month, with Hill on vacation and others away from the office.\nSincerely,\nHJS/dfc\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
