Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nIk Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI discussed the matter of the Kent State, repository -with\nGeorge Hall and have at least some tentative answers.\nIn the first place, the Center is very much interested in\nhaving our tapes at Kent State if details can he worked out. The pa¬\nperwork would he minor, I think, including hilling, correspondence,\nand perhaps an annual report of a brief nature to the Center. The\ntapes would prohahly he for non-hroadcast use and we would like them\nhandled the same way as all other tapes, if this is what Ralph Hall\nwants.\nM£AOQUM*TERS\nJUN 3\nWe quite understand about the Committee evaluation and think\nthis is a good thing. All we can provide is one master tape; any other\ntapes would have to he provided by the repository. We would prohahly\nallow Mr. Hall to charge his regular rate for distribution, hut there\nmight he some requests for non-paid previews. The Center does not\nwish to realize profit on this, necessarily, so the fiscal details\nwill he easy to work out.\nThe questions were a little vague, hence the answers are,\ntoo. You can tell Hall that the Center is very interested and we\nwould like to discuss it further with you and him. Let me know what\nthe next step will he.\nProgram Associate\nDKW:ean"
