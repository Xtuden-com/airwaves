Tragedy of Wuthering Heights.\n(Thirteen 15 minute episodes).\nLittle can be said in synopsis form of Emily Bronte’s masterpiece\nof literature, “Wuthering Heights.’' Such is its; depth and great¬\nness of theme, that no few words may attempt a brief on the plot\nor the characters. Laid on the wild moors of North England, the\nstory traces the lives of two characters who are fused by unknown\nflame into one—Heathcliff and Katherine—the strange antinomies\nof nature—who rebel against the confines of their world—who\nlove until their love becomes hatred. A strange hatred that does\nnot end even at the roadway of death, but continues to shriek in\nthe wild winds of Wuthering Heights, and walks the gray and\nforbidding moors, searching for that which was lost—and which\nwill be regained. Authentically and powerfully has the author\ntranscribed the work of Emily Bronte into living words, and cast\nthem into patterns which are prototype to the characters of the\nbook."
