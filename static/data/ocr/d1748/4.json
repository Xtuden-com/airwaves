Beans, nuts^ cabcage, spinach, and asparagus are\nrich vegetable sources of this mineral, but the calcium from vegetable\neurces is not as well absorbed as that in mil^ Calcium carbonate, lime\nwater, and the calcium in fdrinking water are readily utilized,\nbut should not be substituted for milk, which contains other valuable\nnutritive factors besides calcium.\nPhosphorus, the other constituent of the calcium phosphate in bones,\nis utilized in the body for the formation of bones and teeth, for the\nbuilding of tissue cells and for the regulation of the jifi neutrality\nof the body. The phosphorus requirement is high, being twice tont\nof calcium, or from 0.03 oz to 0.08 Oz per day, the higher values\nbeing required for ehild^a and pregnant or lactating women. In In I $\nstatistical audios, Sherman found that only 4$ of the ^merician dietai^ff\nwere deficient in this valuable food element. The probability of\ndefic^fiucy of phosphorus in human nutrition is very slight, although\nit may be a limiting factor in animal husbandry. Excessive phosphorus\nin the l^praan dietary saould be avoided, or else balanced by tes? increase\nin the calcium intake in order to .avoid excessive loss of calcium from\nthe body throught the alimentary tract. The most favorable ratio is 1\npart of calcium to 2 parts of phosphorus. Among the richer sources of\nphosphorus are cheesf, milk,egg yolk, beans, peas, bread, fish, meat,\noatmeal, and barley* The phosphorus requirement may also be met by the\nuse of inorganic phosphates which are readily utilized."
