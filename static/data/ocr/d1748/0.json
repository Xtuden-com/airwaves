Four hundred million years ago, tae evolutionary anc¬\nestors of man Jrwam in the Cretaceous Sea and crawled in the prl-\nT^jreval slime. At that time,the blood and other bod,/ fluids of our\nlowly ancestor were in equilibrium with the surrounding salt water\nand contained the various salts and mineral elements in the same con¬\ncentration as tne surrounding sea water. Since tae body is very\nsensitive to changes in salt concentration, the survival of tae\nfirst primitive form to venture on dry land depended on ills ability\nto maintain tills normal concentration of salts in the blood and other\nbody fluids. Our evolutionary ancestor solved this problem and\ntransmitted this power of maintaining the normal concentration of\nsalts in the blood as an hereditary characteristic to ills offspring\nThis was so successful, that even at this late date, 40Q,GGQ,QGG\nyears later, we still carry in our blood stream a miniature model of\nthe cretaceous sea, our homeland. In the same way that emigrants\nfrequently carry to their new homes a bit of the soil of their native\ncountry.\nAlthough we are now fully adapted to life on dry land, per¬\nhaps some of us wish it were not so dry year after year and would wel¬\ncome an little more moisture. as a matter/^ of fact, we are not com¬\npletely adapted to life on the land, but each and every one of us\nstill treasures the memory of the free and easy life in the ocean.\nE During our prenatal life, we grow and develop in a fluid envlommeut\na tiny bit of the cretaceous sea stored up within the placental mem¬\nbranes, and during thfcse montfcu^ve relive our evolutionary alstory,\ngoing through all the changes between an aquatic animal and a land\nanimal."
