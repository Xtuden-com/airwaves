Skornia\nVice-President\nChairman, Dept, of Radio\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Harry:\nI just received your inquiry with regard to the Salzburg\nfestival recording proposition and I have answers to your questions.\nThe machines are Magnecorders and are being used to take down\nmaterial for a Stateside record company. Therefore, I don’t think\nthere is any question as to the quality of the recording. There\nare two machines and continuous recording is possible. Merky\nstill hasn’t brought in his estimate, but I have asked him to\nhurry it up*\nWe still haven’t signed up for the Salzburg Festivals since\nconditions have not changed since my last letter.\nYour regards have been passed around to all the persons\nmentioned in your letter. Please let me hear from you soon again.\nSincerely\nW. Stuart Green, D.A.Civ.\nProgram Officer, ISB\nHQ USFA APO 777\nc/o PM, N.Y. N.Y."
