Lardie\nManager\nRadio Station WDYR\nDetroit 6, Michigan\nDear Kay:\nMany thaaks for sending us your fine new book on the WDTE\nschool schedule for this fall* It looks wonderful.\nWe may be bothering you somewhat later in the year to see\nhow this applies to TV, that is, how we can steal some of your\norganisation and production ideas for WOI-TV and apply your audio\ntechniques to video. We*re planning to roll a school of the air\nin mid fall from here.\nYou could help me out on another situation if it would\nprove at all workable from your point of view. It concerns the\nNAEB network which By Siegel has now developed to the point\nit will include 50 stations across the country and which\nNeal Morrison hailed as the \"most significant development in\nradio on the North American continent\" at the Rockefeller\neminar this year in Illinois.\nWe have a number of Canadian programs which could be made\navailable to the NAEB nstwork, but the difficulty is that\nbecause of certain Union requirements, recordings or transcriptions\nof these programs cannot be sent to Siegel in New York. However,\nif any one of our stations could record these programs on direct\nline from Canada, everything would be okay.\nTherefore, the proposition is this: If you are equipped\nto do this recording—either tape or disc—NAEB would be willing\nto pay the line costs from the Windsor station of CBC to your board\nin Detroit at WDTR and also to furnish tapes, etc. for the master\ndisc or copy.\nIf there is any way you can under-take to do this recording,\nwhich would not be tedious—may e one program - or two at the most,\nour whole situation would be greatly simplified.\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience about this.\nSincerely yours.\nRBHsEH\nEnc:\nI\nRichard B. Hull\nPresident"
