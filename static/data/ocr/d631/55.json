  "text": "August 25th, 1950\nMr. Allen Miller\nK W S C\nState College of Washington\nPullman, Washington\nDear Allen:\nAugust 22nd must have been a Red Letter day for you\nbecause both your letter of that date addressed to me,\nand the copy of your letter of that date addressed to\nJim Miles, indicate that you really feel strongly about\ncertain matters.\nFirst off, I should indicate that a great deal of our\nthinking here has been on the assumption that people\nwere at Allerton and, therefore, were up-to-date on the\nmahy discussions concerning the Network. It is unfortunate\nthat you were not there, and it is even moreso that I\nforgot that fact. I shall not attempt to bring you up-to-\ndate in this letter* but I ask you to suspend all judgment\nuntil after the Lexington meeting.\nMost of the criticism that you make of the programs which\nhave been offered thus far are all to^valid. One of the\npoints you did not mention, however, is that we, ourselves,\nare fully cognisant and aware of these short-comings. It\nwas a question of balancing these short-comings against\ngetting things under way, or holding off on launching the\nNetwork altogether.\nA great many of these things are being corrected. A great\nmany more will be corrected when, as and if full time\ncentralized direction of the Network is taken over by the\nUniversity of Illinois, as has been proposed.\nI do not think that Miles, or anyone else, is asking you\nto \"buy\" a plan. All he is seeking is information for a\nsurvey. He wants to find out exactly what resources are\navailable. Obviously, on the basis of your own criticism,\nthe Network has not been able to provide the resources that\nall of us admit are necessary and essential.\n(more)"
