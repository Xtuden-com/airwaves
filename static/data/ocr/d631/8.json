Y.\nDear Sys\nI have a note from Morry who ?/as sent\na request by WBET-FM in Detroit asking about this\nHAEB paid network stuff on 'E HUMAN BEINGS.\nHow about furnishing Morry all the printed\nmaterial and put him on the regular mailing list so\nhe can hit the labor stations with this?\nI*m having a young man assist me somewhat\nin compiling stuff on NAEB business. If you could\nsend us all the printed material you may have on the\nHAEB paid network to date — that is, the ditto stuff—\nwe could assemble in an orderly file and be ready to\nanswer such questions as need to be from here.\nIf you should have a moment, why not dictate\na story for Burton to use in the next News-Letter?\nSincerely,\nHBH/var\nRichard B. Hull\nPresident"
