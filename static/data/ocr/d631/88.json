Hull\nWOI, Iowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Dick;\nSeptember 19, 1950\n.0'\nApparently my writing possesses a talent for\ncarrying a different impression to readers than was my\nintent. Three of you have reached the conclusion in¬\ndependently that I was critical of Sy Siegel's initia¬\ntive in launching the NAEB network when quite the con¬\ntrary is true. We've talked of a network of educational\nstations by relay or transcription since 1939 with little\nprogress. How that Sy has precipitated things the\nquestion is no longer \"shall we?,f but has become \"how can\nwe do it better\"? I have nothing but praise for Sy both\nfor launching the idea and for its operation to date. So\nplease read my previous comments as intended to be con¬\nstructive criticisms.\nI think you should be asking us to \"buy a plan.\"\nThe network will be on an unsound footing in my opinion\nif it counts upon voluntary contributions in any sense.\nA concrete plan in which the costs of operation are\ntranslated into fees for service needed. If I and others\nsee enough benefit for the cost then work will be feasible\non a permanent basis. For a while we can be expected to\nsupport the cost partly because some network plan is needed\nand the start looks promising, but ultimately the plan\nmust be sound in view of costs. A foundation can be\ncalled upon for aid in the early stages of development.\nIf so, let us plan from the beginning how we will pick\nup their part of the cost within the space of the original\ngrant—if possible. Or even better, a foundation might\ngo behind the building of a fine library of programs as\nGeorge Probst suggested a year ago, ones that could be\nrepeated throughout the future.\nSo that you may judge my original letters, I\nam enclosing copies for your files.\n^____Since\n^-\nSincerely yours,\n-\nAllen Miller\nStation Manager\nAMM:gb\nc°: Siegel\nMiles"
