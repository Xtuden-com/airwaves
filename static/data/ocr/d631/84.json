Run it by the new\ncciroiittee and Miles and see what we could\nput together at Islington*\nI think the publicity angle will work\njust as you imagined and could do us a great\ndeal of good*\nFor some reason. I’m a little scared of the\nNBC-ABC-CBS participation* I’ve heard from\nrumors (right or wrong) that in some quarters\nthey regard us as a threat. If true, this would\nbe flattering; on the other hand, it might be\nsingly another tramp under the bed.\nWhy don’t you sound off Bob Saudek and\nsee what he says*\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull\nPresident"
