Association of Educational Broadcasters\n2500 Municipal suilding\nNew York 7, New York.\nNear Mrs. Linder:\nThe Intercollegiate Broadcasting System in th e West last\nyear began a modest tape network as a service to its stations.\nShows are produced by the net members and distributed to the\nothers.\nAs you well know, distribution...speedy and efficient...\nis one of the more difficult aspects of the thing. I was look¬\ning through the NAEB net file of Marilyn Livongfeton of KCVN.\nIt appears that the two, while far different in size, run up\nagainst the same general problems.\nI would appreciate hearing from you on your distribution\nsystem, the effectiveness of the report sheet technique, and\nthe general setup on the distribution end of the NASB net.\nThe IBS loop serves stations in the whole Pacific coast\narea, and this year will probably reach into Idaho, Utah, and\nColorado. Pacific’s KAE0 is the central station. Not every\nshow is fed to every station.\nLast year the net was small and easy (comparitively) to\nhold together. This year it will be larger and I’m casting\nabout for ideas to make sure it stays together again.\nMany congratulations are due you and NAEB for your work\nin the operation and formation of your network. I’ve heard some\nof the shows as they arrive at KCVN. SUch well-known productions\nas the Chicago Round Table and the BBC Theater are a big credit\nto any station, but the less well known shows are fine and do\na good 30b of selling their messages. Good luck in the future.\nYou have a good thing.\nI will appreciate any time you may be able to spare my in¬\nformation request. I’m sure whatever you can offer will be val¬\nuable .\nCordially,\nJohn Witherspoon\nDirector, IBS Region 9"
