Winchers, the Netherlands\nInformation Bureau. Mr# Winchers operates out of the mid-\nwestern division, Holland, Michigan, and if you will recall,\nhas attended several of our NAEB meetings. At the last one\nhe made an extended presentation on the possibility of tying\nin cultural programs from the Netherlands including the\nAmsterdam Symphony. I wonder if it would pay to contact\nhim now that we have facilities for distributing tape. He\nwould be expected to pay all costs from his end. If you\nthink it worthwhile, we can both junp on him.\nNext time you see Ted Cott, ask him if he still\nfeels like sending 100 copies of the RFM to Burton Paulu\nfor distribution. On the ether hand, it may well be that\nCott has stopped doing this since he took over at NBC. Would\nappreciate your comment.\nSincerely,\nRBH/var\nRichard B. Hull\nPresident"
