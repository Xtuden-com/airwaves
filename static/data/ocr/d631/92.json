Wilbur Schramm, Dean\nDivision of Communications '\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear WilburJ\nlour letter of September 8 to Dick Hull makes good sense to me.\nI certainly agree that the exchange program network that we have\nis the most important problem facing the HARD at this time, and\nthe question of whether or not to establish our permanent head¬\nquarters at the University of Illinois is one which I thought\nwas already settled* Was not the University of Illinois desig¬\nnated as our permanent headquarters a number of years ago?\nUntil and unless there is good reason for moving the headquarters\nI am in favor of keeping it on the Illinois campus*\nI hope you are planning to attend the NAEB fall meeting at the\nUniversity of Kentucky and shall be looking forward to seeing\nyou there.\nYours very sincerely.\nRadio Eroadcasting Services\nManager, WUGA(FM)\n•aydon Ausmus, Director\nGAjvw\ncct Richard B.
