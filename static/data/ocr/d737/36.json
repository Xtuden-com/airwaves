City\nDear Mr. Hersh:\nI want to thank you for your prompt reply\ngiving us your reactions to the tests.\nIn reepeot to the questions you have raised,\nI feel too that the problem of blanks to be used in\nsuch tests is a knotty one. As will be stated in our\nreport, we used the Presto Q disc for these tests,\nwhich does not necessarily mean that we recommend this\ndisc as being the best one. However, I don*t believe\nthere is any doubt as to the quality of these discs.\nThe weakness we have found in them is the irregularity\nof the coating; therefore, the discs to be used for\nthese tests were very carefully selected.\nAs a matter of faot in the hands of the\nconsumer these recording machines will be operated\nusing various types of recording blanks. So ability\nof any one machine to adapt itself to a recording\nblank must be considered as a qaalifioatlon of that\nmachine.\nIn all of these tests we used styli recommended\nor furnished by the manufacturer. In the case of your\nmachine, we used a sapphire cutting stylus. As a\nmatter of faot all machines tested used this type of\nstyli.\nWill you please furnish us with list prices\nof the three maohlnes tested. This information is to\nbe part of the report.\nI thank you again for your cooperation with\nour committee in making these testa.\nJfours very truly,\nAJE:EH\nA, James Ebel\nChairman\nNAEB Recording Committee"
