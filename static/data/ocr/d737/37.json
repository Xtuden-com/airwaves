G\nElkhar\nConn\n^ Ltd.\nndlana\nDear Mr. Schuck:\nI wish to thank you very much for your interesting\ncomments on our report on “Instantaneous Recording Machines®•\nI regret I haven1t had an opportunity to answer sooner.\nThe use of the Chromatic Stroboscope in determining\nspeed variation of recording systems Is very Interesting and\nI think very valuable. If It were possible to vary the\nfrequency at which the measurements were made* you could\neasily calibrate the instrument in percentage variation,\nhowever, even with the fixed 440 cycle frequency, you should\nbe able to estimate rather closely the percentage variation.\nWith regard to the measurement of amplitude distortion, I\nthink your comments are very pertinent. The input versus\noutput curves which we used will, of course, only indicate\ndistortion due to asymmetrical wave forms. This will not\ngive any of the odd harmonic components.\nThe use of a pick up and distortion meter Is very\nsatisfactory if the distortion Introduced by the pick up is\nknown, ^his might be obtained by purposely adding known amounts\nof distortion to a recording. The measure distortion would\nnot only contain the known amount but also the distortion of\nthe pick up devise. Of course several distortion measurements\nwould have to be made because the residual distortion In a\nrecording head can not be eliminated.\nWith regard to the units used, we measured the pattern\nwidths In millimeters and converted them to decibels, however,\nsince the various recording heads took different power levels\nto obtain standard recording levels, the units had to be\narbitrary showing only the relationship between the input and\noutput of arbitrary units. I think we shoud, however. Indicate\nthe standard recording level for each type head, thus standard¬\nising the ordinates of the various curves."
