Y.\nAugust 1st, 1939*\nMr* A* James Ebel, Chairman,\nNAEB Recording Committee,\nUniversity of Illinois,\nUrbana, Ill*\nDear Mr* Ebel:-\nWe thank you for your letter of July 29th, giving us a prelim¬\ninary result of the performance tests on the three recording\nmachines we sent to you*\nAlthough the results on our machines seem satisfactory, it\nwill be most interesting to compare these with recorders of\nother manufacture•\nWe have no comments on the test as outlined in your specifica¬\ntions, as we feel that they are perfectly satisfactory* The\nonly question we have to raise is one concerning which we have\nhad much grief in testing our own recorders* This is the ques¬\ntion of blanks* We wonder whether in your tests you have\npicked blanks which were absolutely flat and true and were ab¬\nsolutely uniform in regard to material* We have experienced\nconsiderable variation in our tests, due to variation in re¬\ncording blanks*\nWere these tests conducted with sapphire or steel cutting\nstyli? There will be a difference in results obtained, not\nonly in material of the cutting point but also variation on\ntype of point* We have found that instability or wow may\nsometimes be traced to faulty blanks or faulty recording\nStyli*\nWe thank you again for your interest and will look forward to\nseeing the comparative tabulation on these machines*\nYours very truly,\nDAVID BOGEN CO* INC*\nJBH/cs\nDictaphone\nMANUFACTURERS\nPUBLIC ADDRESS EQUIPMENT\nCENTRALIZED PROGRAM SYSTEMS\nINTERCOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS"
