The operation of the complete combination unit\nis described in this instruction book on page 6 and this may be used in\nits entirety in the operation of the portable setup as illustrated in Figure\nU,\nService Notes-\nThe combination Models 212RC and 16RC have been designed so as to give\nquick and easy access to the tubes In the amplifier should it become neces-\nsary to do so.\nThe ampiifier is fastened to the front of the case, which is hinged on the\nbottom. Removing two screws in the upper corners of the large control panel\nand two screws on the SIDES of the case, near the front, allows the ampliÂ¬\nfier to swing forward on its hinges. All tubes are now accessible for test\nor replacement. Figure E shows the position of these tubes, as well as the\nplug and socket arrangement for the amplifier.\nShould it become necessary to service the amplifier, it may easily be removed\nby disconnecting the sockets shown in Figure E, then removing the four\nmounting screws on the swinging front of the case. This front may be entirely\nseparated from the case proper, as the hinges are slip type, y\n-16-"
