Griffith\nElectrical Technician\nUniversity of Iowft\nIowa Cityi Iowa\nDear Mr. Griffith:\nB I wish to express my appreciation for the s\\ig~\ngested modifications you supplied for the NAEB instantaneous\nrecording machine tests. Your suggestions are all well\ntaken and a number of them could have been incorporated in\nthe proposed specifications had they been received earlier.\nBut since the specifications have been cent out to all\nthe manufacturers, there is not a great deal that oan be\ndone at this particular time. However, certain of the s\nsuggestions will be inoorporated if agreeable to the\nindividual manufacturers at the time of the teat.\nI shouldllike to oomment on m few oft your sug~\ngestlons. I think Id is a very good suggestion and could\nwell be incorporated. In IIIo, while the measurement of\nhill and dale modulation is desirable, I think that it is\nsufficiently included in the noise level measurement\nsince both recording and playback on that particular\nmeasurement are to be made on the same table.\nWith reference to Item 4, practically all of the\noomment that I have received on the proposed tests have\nrecommended that this section of the recording tests be\nomitted, as did you. However, all of these comments have\ncome from engineers. I agfcee with them that this test is\nmost unsoientifiw, but these machines are going to be used\nin a number of oases by people who have no conception\nwhatsoever of the scientific side of recording and merely\nwant to know how the recordings will sound. Since all\nrecordings will be played over the same system at the same\ntime some element of comparison should be possible.\nPerhaps after conducting this particular section\nof the test, we shall know better whether or not the result"
