  "text": "A LIGHT PATTERN CALIBRATION CHART\nThe art of Instantaneous recording has advanced so rapidly\nin the past few years that today standards for recording equip¬\nment are on a level with those of other reproducing equipment*\nNo longer can the recorder employ hit and miss methods in deter¬\nmining the characteristics of his recording equipment. Much\nhas been written in the past in Electronics^ and other technical\npublications concerning the light pattern method of determining\nthe frequency response characteristics. Less has been written\nconcerning methods of determining amplitude distortion using the\nsame method. In either case it is necessary to know what power\nlevel is represented by the widths of the various bands. Fig. 1\nIs a photograph typical of a frequency response pattern. While\ninspection will show that the head records up to 10,000 cycles\nand has a peak at 5000 cycles, the amount of equalisation neces¬\nsary can only be determined after evaluating in terms of DB the\npower levels represented by the band widths.\nIn 1930 Buchmann and Meyer* 2 described a method whereby\nthe recorded velocity can be determined by inspection of the\nlight pattern formed when oblique light falls on the record.\nIt was shown that\nwhere\n- Wtm\n~ 60\"\nV s stylus velocity in cm/seo.\nW Z Band width in cm.\nN = RPM at which recording was made\n(1)\nt.
