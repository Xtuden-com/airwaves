C.\nPhone North 7-6000\nVol. Ill No. 1\nMarch 1964\nCOPYRIGHT LAW REVISION\nThis is a second report on copyright developments affecting educational broadcast¬\ning. Before reporting on their current status, it will be helpful to provide back¬\nground and review of events leading up to the present situation.\nThe Need for Modernizing the Copyright Law\nThe present Copyright Law was enacted in 1909. So many technological changes\nhave taken place since then, particularly in the ways materials may be recorded,\nreproduced, and transmitted that vigorous efforts to revise the Act have been\nmade in recent years. In 1955, Congress authorized the Copyright Office to conduct\nstudies on revision of the copyright law and in 1961, the Register of Copyrights\nsubmitted to Congress tentative recommendations for such revision. During the\npast year, the Copyright Office has conducted a number of panel discussions to\nconsider these recommendations and comment upon the Register’s preliminary draft.\nThe revision attempts to extend the present concept of copyright (developed to cover\nintellectual creations reproduced in printed form) to cover a variety of new methods\nof publishing made possible by present technology and those forthcoming in the\nfuture. Education has now made a preliminary statement of its viewpoint.\nActivities Expressing Education’s Concern\nIn March,1962, NEA called a national conference on professional, legal, and ethical\nproblems for teachers in connection with technological developments in education,\nincluding copyright problems.\n(1) e.g., audio records and tapes, video tapes, photo-copy, microfilm, radio,\ntelevision, etc.\n(2) Including conversion of printed material into electronic information which can\nbe stored in computerized libraries retrievable for widespread dissemination via\ncable or microwave and print-out at multi-reception points."
