Such remote broadcasts are really on-the-spot news coverage and constitute something of a newsbreak for the radio station which can\nprovide broadcast facilities at that time. Invariably, the remote broadcast is of sufficient news interest to receive attention in the press and radio.\nBut the station which can provide on-the-spot broadcasts is the station to which people will always return. In this department WNYC’s micro¬\nphones combed the city throughout the year for the special events that are page one news in the next day’s newspaper.\n-11-"
