  "text": "There may be, however, some broader objection to the use of the methods which have\nbeen herein proposed. For instance one might logically take exception to the use\nof the term \"wind\" to describe the combined relationships. At first it was thought\nthat the word “type\" would be more appropriate. However, as one film producer\npointed out, this might be easily confused with accepted terminology used to des¬\ncribe the Kelvin temperature characteristics of color films.\nUpon reconsideration it seems that use of the word \"wind\" creates no real conflicts,\neven though the word itself is not necessarily appropriate. It might be best to\nlook upon this usage as an extension of the present definition of \"wind\" rather\nthan an alteration of its basic meaning. On the other hand perhaps someone can\nsuggest another suitable term, such as \"class\" or \"style,\" for describing this\nquantity.\nIt is left, therefore, to the scrutiny of wiser and more experienced minds to evalu¬\nate the wisdom of certain assumptions which have been made. The writer will be ex¬\ntremely grateful to receive comments regarding this material from people who are\nwell seasoned on the art of 16mm. film processing. Until such a time that these\nideas can be adequately evaluated it is best that they be treated as contemporary\ndiscussion and material for thought and experimentation."
