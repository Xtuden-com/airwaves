C. 20036\nOFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nMEMORANDUM\nFOR: Ad Hoc Committee on Program Practices\nNovember 3, 1969\nREPORT ON SURVEY OF ACCEPTANCE AND\nREJECTION PATTERNS OF NETWORK PROGRAMS\nBY EDUCATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION\nSTATIONS\nA survey of station behavior with regard to acceptance or\nrejection of programs offered by a network is usually considered\nan internal management affair. It is typically conducted by\nthe programming network to determine the extent to which its\nservice is acceptable to the stations who must bear the respon¬\nsibility for what is broadcast.\nThe impetus for this survey was different. It was initiated\nas a consequence of a resolution passed by the membership of\nthe NAEB at its 1968 convention in Washington, D.C. Specifically,\nthe resolution called for the NAEB to: \"Conduct a study of its\nmember stations to determine each outlet's performance in the\ncritical area of broadcasting of nationally distributed and/or\nnetwork materials dealing with racial matters.\"\nThe reason for this section of the resolution was the feeling\nheld by its authors that educational stations not only failed\nto initiate local programs dealing with civil rights, but they\nalso failed to broadcast programs about racial matters easily\navailable to them from national network sources. For some,\nthe purpose of the survey was to document this assumption;\nfor others, it was to disprove it. Those whose responsibility\nit has been to undertake the survey have opted to study the\nbasic data relating to station-network relationships, thereby\nproviding a frame of reference within which to examine special\ninformation concerning any program category.\nThe area of station-network relationships is a sensitive one\nunder the best of circumstances. The station wants as much\nfreedom as possible, and the network prefers as much control"
