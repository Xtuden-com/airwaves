  "text": "-6-\nThe collection of information about educational television was\nsubstantially different, mainly because of the difference in\ntype of service provided by the two national networks. Initially,\ncontact with NET officials indicated that compilations of data\nconcerning program selection of the scheduled service by affiliate\nstations would be available for use in this study if permission\nwere obtained on a station-by-station basis for its use. Preliminary\ntabulations were made, and contact with each station was initiated\nto obtain permission. Without any follow-up, more than 20 of the\n29 stations that had rejected programs for content or had rejected\nmore than 107, of the scheduled service quickly gave permission for\ntheir comments to be used.\nWhile this approval was being obtained, NET withdrew its data,\nindicating that a prior decision by the Affiliates Council,\nnot communicated to the full staff, precluded its use outside\nof NET. The NAEB protested this decision and requested the\nAffiliates Council to reconsider the matter at a meeting in\nMadison, Wisconsin, October 15. The Council rejected the request.\nAccordingly, it was necessary to contact stations directly for\ninformation. This was done, largely by telephone, during the week\nof October 27. In every case, stations freely discussed the\nvarious considerations in program selection from the national\nservices. Their comments and the basic data generated by this\nsection of the survey are compiled on the following pages."
