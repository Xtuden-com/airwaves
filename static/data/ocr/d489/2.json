James\nDirector of Audio Visual Center\nAssociate Professor of Education\nNorfolk State College\n2401 Corprew Avenue\nNorfolk, Virginia 23504\nDear Grady:\nI really appreciate your letter of December 5 complimenting our NAEB\nMinority Programming PracticesCommittee as it provided meaningful\nsessions at tKe NAEB the\" last couple of years. It is wonderful that\nyou are interested in serving on the Committee. Your background and\nexperience, I know, would provide the Committee with a great resource.\nUnfortunately, I do not know the present state of the Committee and\nthe new division of minority affairs.\nI have talked with Bill Greaves and suggested that I would be avail¬\nable to assist in any way. At this time I do not know whether there\nis a Programming Practices Committee and what the machinery is for\nappointing new members. If you remember, I resigned as chairman be¬\ncause I felt that this post should be held by a member of a minority\ngroup. As soon as I have any word about the new structure, etc., I'll\nlet you know.\nIn the meantime, my very best for the new year.\nSincerely,\nfUMn\nRJM/bg\ncc: William Harley\nJames Fellows\nWilliam Greaves\nRichard J. Meyer\nDirector\nSchool Television Service"
