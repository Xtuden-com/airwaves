  "text": "Mr. William G. Harley\nPage 2\nNovember 4, 1968\nand I respectfully request permission to appear and report to\nthe assembled Convention the form of resolution which we\nproposed before revision. I intend to publicly disassociate\nmyself from the Executive Committeeâ€™s action and to make it\nclear that I believe the time is now for public broadcasting\nto stand up and be counted with policies which are in the\nspirit and letter of recent FCC rule making and Supreme Court\ndecisions.\nI believe that some of the changes were made in sincerity\nbut I am not so naive as to think that the Executive Committee\nis doing other than attempting to duck controversy. We are\npast the point of argument for argument's sake. The type of\naction that the Program Practices Committee is seeking is\nthat with which we were che we were assembled.\nEdward L. Mcrris\nDirector of Programming\nSince\nELM: jf\ncc: Richard J. Meyer"
