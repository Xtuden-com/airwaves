  "text": "Memo - Dr. Richard Meyer - 10/15/68\nParagraph #4 - There was concern here that the second sentence\nbeginning \"It is urged-\" while admirable in\nthe ideal could place an impossible burden on\nmany small stations with limited staff and\nfinancial resources. The sentence now reads as\nfollows:\n\"It is urged, therefore, that stations develop\npositive sensitivity among all levels of sta¬\ntion personnel toward the target audiences\nand that the minimum implementation consist\nof naming one staff member who shall be\ncharged with the responsibility of: (1) main¬\ntaining liaison between the station and the\ntarget audiences; (2) conducting internal\ntraining which will assist staff members in\nestablishing ties with the target audiences;\n(3) lending special expertise for programming\nin this area.\"\nParagraph #5 - In the opening sentence \"will\" is deleted and\n\"should\" is substituted. It is agreed that the\nproject should be continued. Until adequate\nfunding is secured, the NAEB cannot officially\nsay that it \"will\" be continued. The Executive\nStaff, of course, supports the idea and is working\nto see that it is implemented.\nParagraph #6 - Deleted completely. The mechanics of the project\nwill be worked out; that is understood. This\nparagraph appeared to us to be irrelevant and\nparticularly weak as a way to end an otherwise\nconstructive, dynamic resolution.\nA copy of the revised resolution as modified by Staff is included\nfor your information. I would hope that these minor changes are\nacceptable to your Committee; if so, this is the way the resolution\nwill be presented to the Board, November 21, with Staff endorsement.\nAgain, may I say that the Staff commends the impressive manner in\nwhich your Committee met its charge.\nAttachment\nWGH:lm"
