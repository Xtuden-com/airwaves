We wiUsh to move forward in this\narea also.\nHowever, the continuing distribution of information about\nprogramming for minority groups cannot be carried on in\nthe same way we conducted this effort last year until we\nfind a continuing means of supporting it. Last years's\nproject succeeded only after we raised funds privately to\nfinance it.

We are looking into this as\nwell, and may find it a satisfactory alternative.\nWhen this activity resumes, it will be a responsibility\nof your committee to see that the information gathering\nand dissemination, by whatever device we employ, meets\nthe needs of both stations and minority groups.\nMeanwhile, we do have this much to report. We have received\nadditional funds to support a special issue of the Educa¬\ntional Broadcasting Review in which we will publish“e tfTt ed\nversions of the Kenneth IjTark reports and similar data from\nthe N.A.B. We shall also have special articles that\namplify some of the brief case studies and a “Memorandum\nto Station Managers^ by Rick Breitenfeld which will suggest"
