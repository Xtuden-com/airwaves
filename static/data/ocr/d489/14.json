Because the networking operation for radio is different\nfrom that for television, the reporting systems have been kept\ndistinct. In each case, however, we have provided general inforÂ¬\nmation about the program acceptance and rejection patterns, a\nselection of station comments elaborating on the reasons for\nrejecting, and a station-by-station listing of those stations\nthat participated in the survey, and in the case of television,\nthose stations that rejected more than 10% of the NET scheduled\nservice."
