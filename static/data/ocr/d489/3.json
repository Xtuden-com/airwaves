C. 20036\nOFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nMEMORANDUM\nFOR:\nAd Hoc Committee on Program Practices of\nEducational Stations\nJuly 8, 1969\nWe have made considerable progress in arranging for\ninformation to provide an adequate study of program\nacceptance and rejection patterns of national programs\nby educational radio and television stations. Nearly\nall of the required data are available in the records\nof the National Educational Radio Network and the\nNational Educational Television Network. We believe\nit is important to check with each station that will\nbe listed as having rejected \"scheduled service\" pro¬\ngrams from the national sources so that the station\ncan amplify reasons for rejection. In many instances\nthese were in the nature of private communications\nbetween the stations and the networks, and we feel\nthey should be given an opportunity to expand on them\nif they wish. We are now reviewing the data and pre¬\nparing letters to stations on this matter.\nThe Executive Board of Directors of the NAEB took a\nfirm stand favoring the study of program acceptance and\nrejection patterns and urged stations to cooperate in\nreleasing or providing data so that a useful report\ncan be generated. The Memorandum to the Executive\nBoard from Dr. Meyer suggested a resolution, which the\nBoard adopted. The Memorandum and the Resolution are\nattached.\nWith regard to convention planning we have two major\nprogram recommendations that are being considered.\na) a panel presentation concerning programing\ncreated by and for minority group represent¬\natives; emphasis would be on programing\ncreated by^ minorities, not programing about\nminority \"problems.\""
