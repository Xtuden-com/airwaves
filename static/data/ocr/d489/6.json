  "text": "MEMORANDUM\nFOR: EXECUTIVE BOARD\nMay 12, 1969\nThe NAEB’s Ad Hoc Committee on Program Practices of Educational\nStations has undertaken the following activities relevant to\nthe membership resolution adopted at the November Convention.\na) Advised on content and readership for a special issue\nof the Educational Broadcasting Review concerned with\ndevelopment and support of educational radio and\ntelevision programs for minority groups and the dis¬\nadvantaged.\nb) Has worked with the R & D Staff on development of\nthe scope and procedures for a study of national net¬\nwork program acceptance and rejection patterns by\neducational stations.\nc) Solicited topics and suggestions that will implement\nconcerns of the Committee in the program of the 1969\nConvention.\nOn the matter of program acceptance patterns, we have a request\nto make of the Executive Board of Directors. To avoid dup¬\nlicating questionnaires to the Stations, we have first examined\nwhether such data already existed in the files of NER and NET.\nLuckily, most of the material needed is available from these\nsources; since it was collected for administrative purposes,\nhowever, we would not want to use such data in our report with¬\nout permission of the stations involved. While we do not know\nwhether they will all wish to cooperate, we feel it would be\nhelpful if the Executive Board were to pass the following\nresolution urging stations to make this information available.\nResolved, that the Executive Board of Directors of the NAEB\nacknowledges the importance of the study of national program\nacceptance and rejection patterns mandated at the 1968 conven¬\ntion and urges educational radio and television stations to\ncooperate in making available data needed to conduct this study\nRichie Meyer\n' Chairman"
