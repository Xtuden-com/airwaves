Stations\nare eligible to receive such programs on the basis of the mem¬\nbership category to which they subscribe. Their selection of\ncategory depends upon their broadcast schedule and budget.\nBecause there are so many more programs offered than are likely\nto be accepted, it is not reasonable to set a percentage for\nacceptance and cite those stations which reject a higher figure.\nAccordingly, we have taken three programs that are clearly concerned\nwith racial and civil rights matters and indicated those stations\nwhich selected them for broadcast. In addition, we have provided\na range of comments from stations which did. not order these pro¬\ngrams .\nThe Negro American - a fifteen minute \"talk\" program produced\nby WDTR-FM(Detroit Public Schools).\nList of Stations Receiving Program Through NERN 'v\nKASU-FM, Jonesboro, Arkansas.\nKLON-FM, Long Beach, California.\nSacramento, California.\nSan Mateo, California.\nFort Collins, Colorado.\nTampa, Florida.\nWABE-FM, Atlanta, Georgia.\nWSIU-FM, Carbondale, Illinois.\nChicago, Illinois.\nNormal, Illinois\nPark Ridge, Illinois.\nFlossmoor, Illinois.\nGary, Indiana\nLafayette, Indiana.\nMuncie, Indiana.\nMuncie, Indiana.\nNotre Dame, Indiana.\nSouth Bend, Indiana.\nTerre Haute, Indiana.\nValparaiso, Indiana.\nRichmond, Indiana.\nDesMoines, Iowa.\nKFKU-AM/FM, Lawrence, Kansas.\nKSAC-AM/FM, Manhattan, Kansas.\nWBKY-FM, Lexington, Kentucky.\nWFPK/WFPL-FM, Louisville, Kentucky.\nKERS-FM,\nKCSM-FM,\nKCSU-FM,\nWUSF-FM,\nWBEZ-FM,\nWNIU-FM,\nWMTH-FM,\nWHFH-FM,\nWGVE-FM,\nWBAA-AM,\nWBST-FM,\nWWHI-FM,\nWSND-FM,\nWETL-FM,\nWISU-FM,\nWVUR-FM,\nWECI-FM,\nKDPS-FM,"
