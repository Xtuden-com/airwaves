Thus again\ndo we need to seek program grants and the above sources\nmay be accessable.\nStations will participate more in ghetto programming once\nthey find out how to do it. We find the desire to do it is\ngreater than the confidence and ability to do it. We need\nto assemble case history material which can be useful in\nshowing program managers around the country what successful\nprogramming can be and what results it can have in their\nown communities.\nWith the help of the Commission on Human Relations, we\nare also preparing lists of persons throughout the country\nwho can be used as consultant for such programming. We\nare also preparing guidelines for covering civil distur¬\nbances, and will distribute Ben Holman's Denver speech to\nall stations in the knowledge that there were a number\nunable to hear it there.\nProposed Committee Structure\nIt appears clear that the committee must be of two parts:\nprogramming and employment. Those two parts, both in agencies\nwho work with them professionally and in the kind of people in\nour world with whom those problems rest, are quite separate.\nWe recommend the creation of two separate committees,both\nrelatively small. These committees would be: NAEB Advisory\nCommittee on Employment and NAEB Advisory Committee on\nProgramming. They would report to the NAEB Executive\nCommittee. They would be composed of at least one board\nmember each and representatives of various interests and\nabilities in their membership. For membership on the employ¬\nment committee, we would look to those who have interest in\nrecruiting and training as well as a sensitivity for those\nwith some experience in matters of racial discrimination.\nOn the programming side, certainly representation must be\nsought from NET and NER as entities or nothing will result."
