C. 20036\nNovember 1969\nThe attached material is a survey report of educational\nstation acceptance and rejection of programs from\nnational services. The study was called for by a\nresolution of the NAEB members in November, 1968.\nThe survey covers the period from October 1968 through\nMarch 1969. While we have no reason to question the\nvalidity of the information reported in the survey, the\ntime period of the study requires that two major points\nbe kept in mind:\n1) Comments about rejection of educational radio\nprograms because of technical and mechanical\nproblems are peculiarly related to the period\nstudied. Since that time, rejection of\nprograms for these reasons has been significantly\nreduced as a consequence of complete technical\nupgrading of equipment and the coordination of\nthe network operation at new headquarters in\nWashington. This has increased markedly the\nacceptance of many NERN programs.\n2) Comments about television programs, since they\ncite only rejections of the national service,\ndo not reveal significant efforts by stations\nin any area of program service on December 1, 1969,\nThe NAEB will publish an affirmative report of\nactivity by educational stations in programming\nfor minority groups. It is titled - Broadcasting\nand Social Action, a Handbook for Station\nExecutives."
