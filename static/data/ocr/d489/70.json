It\nis, therefore, entirely proper that its recommendation go\nto the Executive Committee of the Board (which reviews all\nmatters to be considered by the Board)• The Board will\nthen consider the Committee recommendation and make a\nreport to the membership at the business meeting. Although\nI cannot, of course, know in advance what the Board will do\nI have no reason to believe that the Board will not accept\nthe Committee's recommendation. It will certainly have my\nfull support and the endorsement of the Staff.\nAgain, let me say that the Committee deserves highest com¬\nmendation for an excellent job and I am most appreciative\nof the service that you and your fellow members have per¬\nformed for the Association.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:1m\nccs Richard J. Meyer"
