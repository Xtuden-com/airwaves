Educational Broadcasting and\nSocial Responsibility will undoubtedly lead to addition¬\nal attention to the basic topic by the main general\nsession and luncheon speakers.\nDuring July much of the program planning for the conven¬\ntion will be intensified and we have scheduled a meeting\nin Washington with Dr. Meyer for July 14. At that time\nwe will go over these items and report on any other\ndevelopments that have occured by then. I know it would\nbe useful to him if he could have your reactions to this\nstatus report before he comes here to meet with us and\nwork further on these matters.\nBest regards.\nJames A.
