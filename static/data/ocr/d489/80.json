Employment: By observation and report we know that\na good many Negroes are employed in greater or lesser\npositions throughout the United States in ETV and\neducational radio stations, as well as in other assign¬\nments. There should be many more, both to reflect their\ntrue percentage in the community, and to give us the\nbenefit of talents from new sources brought into our\nindustry. We need to know what today's facts are, but\nmore importantly, what tomorrow's needs will be. We\nfirst should take a survey of Negroes in jobs today and\nwhat future job needs in all categories there will be\ntomorrow so we can correctly assess what the needs will\nbe nationally. Such a survey can be done with all due\ncaution and professional guidance from the Equal Employ¬\nment Opportunities Commission and other agencies.\nWe must then look toward training and recruiting. There\nare not significant numbers of Negroes in educational\nbroadcasting today, at least not as many as we might\nexpect, because, among other things, they have never been\nadvised that this is a worthwhile area to seek."
