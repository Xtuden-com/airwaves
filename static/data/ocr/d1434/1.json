YoufLL recall\nthat as of January 1, JCET was reconstituted as a Joint Council.\nETRC IS NOW A MEMBER, AND NCCET MAY BE NEW CONSTITUENT MEMBER, TOO,\nIF THINGS WORK OUT. UNDER THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS THE JCET WASHINGTON\nOFFICE WILL BE GLAD TO SERVE NAEB RADIO AND TELEVISION MEMBERS.\nQuite often Ralph Steetle, or Cy Braum, or. Walter Emery run across.\nSOMETHING IN WASHINGTON THAT RELATES TO NAEB MEMBER PROBLEMS. ThEY!RE\nALWAYS GLAD TO HELP, ARE AVAILABLE FOR HELP THERE, AND ALSO WILL BE\nKEEPING' THE NAEB HEADQUARTERS IN URBANA FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THINGS\nGETTING QR NEEDING ATTENTION IN WASHINGTON.\nOne area in which there is NAEB concern these days, obviously,\nIS WHAT MIGHT BE OONE WITH THE VHFrUHF PROBLEM, THE RESERVATION OF\nEDUCATIONAL CHANNELS, ' AND ANY POSSIBLE CHANGES ANY CHANGE MIGHT BRING\nABOUT TO RESERVED FM CHANNELS, OR FM IN GENERAL. NAEB ATTORNEYS,\nCohn & Marks, have filed in our behalf, and will be keeping the NAEB\nPOSITI ON* BEFORE THE FCC. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SPECIAL THOUGHTS ON\nTHE MATTER. SEND THEM TO HEADQUARTERS, ANO THEY1LL BE FOLLOWED UP.\nFor example,* Harolo Engel, WHA, has been a needler on the possible\ndamage to FM. Good to see the spirits high. .\nWell this will make chief prodder, Harold Hill, happy when it\nshows up in Urbana on Monday morning\".
