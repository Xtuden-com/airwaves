Dykema,\nProfessor of Music Education at Teachers College, Columbia\nUniversity; and “The Educational Program,” by Merrill\nDenison.\nAny or all of these studies, designed largely as the basis\nfor discussion by educational classes, clubs, or social groups,\nas well as the program bulletins, can be obtained free of\ncharge, by writing to The Radio Institute of the Audible\nArts, 80 Broadway, New York City."
