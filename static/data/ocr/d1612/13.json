Listener Research, and \"Impact _Studie_s.._!!„ If non¬\ncommercial educational PM broadcasting is to flourish, it must not only\nsucceed but be able to prove that it has succeeded — in terms both of\nachieving a significant audience and of serving that audience well*\nListener research is of the essence, both to establish the fact that\nsomebody is listening and to establish the impact of particular programs\non particular audiences* An organization of educational broadcast\nstations should begin exploring this field at once*\n10* Publicizing Educational FM Broadcasting* Perhaps the\ngreatest failure of the pioneer educational standard broadcast stations\nnow on the air is their failure to publicize their own magnificent\nachievements.

Such\ncitizens councils, made up of educators and lay representatives, are\nneeded to support physical planning and to advise on program develop¬\nments. Possibly membership could be on the basis of election by already"
