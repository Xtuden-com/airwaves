These pioneers have learned the\nhard way. They have had notable success—a fact hidden by the inade¬\nquacies of most commercial listener polls and by the stations1 failure\nto publicize themselves nationally. If the scores or hundreds of\nnewcomers to educational broadcast station management are to flourish,\nthey should have available without delay the accumulated experience\nof the successful pioneers. The interchange of experience between the\npioneers and newcomers will in many instances make the difference between\nsuccess and failure *\nAs a minimum, a strong organization of educational FM broad®\ncasters should have a regular monthly publication devoted in part to\nnew developments in educational FM and in part to mobilizing the ex¬\nperience of existing stations. On the basis of interest already\nevidenced, it may be expected that such a publication would have from\nthe beginning a circulation of several thousand among persons deeply\ninterested in educational FM broadcast station operation.\nIn'addition, the organization would prepare and publish a\nseries of monographs on successive aspects of station planning and\noperation, beginning with cost and engineering data and carrying on\nthrough to programing problems, policies, and possibilities.\n6. Personnel Procurement. A broadcast station is much like\nan automobile; its ability to get where it wants to go without an\naccident depends more on the driver than on any other single factor."
