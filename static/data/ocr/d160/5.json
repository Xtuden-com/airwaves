It\nis sent to you at this time merely for information. There will be\nsupporting papers for many of the items so that you will have more back¬\nground information, but it was not thought wise to send them out at\nthis time, because you would simply have to bring them to Columbus with\nyou.\nThe agenda„ naturally, is not the “‘last word’®. It is anticipated that\nthere will be changes, additions, etc,, made at the recommendation of the\nBoard."
