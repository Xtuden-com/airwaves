Operating\non the theory that it is therefore imperative to improve and expand network\nservice, the staff has instituted regular programming from Washington, D.C,,\nthe Network Acceptance Committee has taken a more active role in programming\naspects of the network, and plans are currently being made for improved\nservice to Network members (See Agenda Item #10 }.\nin addition0 the NAEB Live Network Committee has been proceeding with\nexploratory plans and has held two meetings to that end. Live networking\n(and proper planning for it) is a reality we must face with increasing responsibility 0\nThe role of the NAEB Network Manager has become increasingly difficult and\nimportant. He already is responsible for supervision of seven employees and\nworks with the Administrative Vice President on fiscal affairs of the network.\nIt is anticipated that his role will become even more administrative as Network\nactivities increase, especially if it is possible to add a regular program director\nto the network staff.\nRecomme ndation\nIt is recommended that the Board create the position of Vice President for Network\nAffairs (to replace the present position of Network Manager). It is further\nrecommended that the Board approve Robert E. Underwood, Jrc â€ž for this position0"
