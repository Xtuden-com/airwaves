  "text": "-5-\nResearch and Development\nIt is our belief that the only way the NAEB can continue to\ngrow, and at the same time serve not only its members but the educaÂ¬\ntional community at large, is through the establishment of a soundly\nbased Office of Research and Development. As a beginning, we are\nrecommending that a portion of the overhead from future contracts\naccrue to the Office of Research and Development, and eventually\nthat the only income from projects to the general administration\nbudget be in the form of an administrative charge against the\nOffice of Research and Development. In future years we believe\nthat a realistic financial basis for research and development\nservices would also include a certain allocation each year to that\nOffice from the general administration budget and the budgets of\nthe various divisions.\nWhile we realize that financial restrictions have prevented\nour preparing a near ideal budget, we feel that we must pare all\nexpenses as far as possible until income justifies rebuilding\nour staff and expanding our services to the level we feel our\nmembership requires.\n25/1/12/66"
