  "text": "-2-\nNow we are changing to an accrual system and will be billing\nmembers on a fiscal basis beginning July 1, 1966. Therefore, the\nbillings for this January can only be for one-half year's dues.\nThus, while the annual income from institutional dues is approxi¬\nmately $50,000-$55,000, billing for only one-half year will result\nin our having approximately $25,000 less income from institutional\ndues during the current fiscal year.\nImmediately upon receipt of the Arthur Young and Company\nrecommendation, the executive staff began a series of meetings\nto study possible courses of action to meet this shortage. Several\ndecisions have already been made:\n1. No further loans to either the Instruction Division or\nthe Individual Member Division are to be made beyond present\ncommitments. These advances, carried as accounts receivable on\nthe books of the Corporation, to date total approximately $13,000.\nThe Instruction Division has already established a budget and\ninstituted a Division fee, and the staff will present a proposal\nat the meeting for an Individual Member Division fee.\n2. Three staff psoitions have been temporarily eliminated,\none of which had been paid for by a loan to the Individual Member\nDivision. The other two are in the Office of Research and Develop¬\nment. This will result in a cash saving of $7,800 by the end of\nthe fiscal year.\n3. Staff reductions make possible a reduction in rent for\noffice space. ($900 annually)"
