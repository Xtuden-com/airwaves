Thus, in the recent meeting held in Chicago,\nattendance was not restricted to those in Region III, but was also\nopen to members in Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, and so on. The meeting\nwas called the NAEB Midwest Conference, sponsored by Region III, Likewise,\nthe recent meeting sponsored by Region II was called the Southern Conference\nand was open to members in Arkansas, Louisiana, and so on. In either case,\nif it is decided to hold such meetings, rather than smaller confernces\nfor those with zimilar professional interests, we feel that there is a\nneed for more frequent area meetings than we have held in the past and a\nneed for greater involvement by the headquarters staff.\nWe are also reviewing the need for the special instructional television\nconference in light of other possibilities that now exist through the\nNational Project for the Improvement of Televised Instruction.\nThe staff, and I amssure the task force that the President is\nappointing, will welcome any suggestions as we continue to develop the\nconvention and conferences plans. This report indicates only the progress\nto date in the comprehensive study now underway*"
