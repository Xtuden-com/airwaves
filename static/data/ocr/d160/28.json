The Arthur\nYoung & Co. report recommends that this separation not be maintained\nin the future, but that gross income and gross expenses for such\noperations be included in the G.A. budget. Therefore, since the\n1966-67 budget has been prepared in line with this recommendation,\nthe 1965-66 budgets have been adjusted to reflect gross figures -\nto facilitate comparison.\nFor your information, the totals below are the original net\nfigures. In other words the $145,400 represents the budget approved\nat Columbus and modified slightly at the Convention.\nIncome\nExpenses\nPresent\nBudget\n$145,400\n145,400\n$ -0-\nProposed\nRevised\nBudget\n$120,680\n136,494.22\n$(15.814.22)"
