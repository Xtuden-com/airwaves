This was accomplished in spite of expenditures in the last\n18 months of nearly $11,000 for extra-ordinary legal and accounting\nfees. In addition to these expenses, the recent re-organization\nat USOE has resulted in delays in our obtaining anticipated\ncontracts which will cost us approximately $9,000 in unrealized\noverhead.\nIn spite of these problems, we had every confidence that we\ncould end the current fiscal year without incurring a deficit.\nWithout any additional changes it would still be possible to do so.\nHowever, the accounting study just completed by Arthur\nYoung and Company strongly recommends that we put our accounting\nsystem on an accrual basis and that we begin to bill our members\non a fiscal rather than calendar basis. Both of these ideas had\nbeen discussed by the staff and had been considered advisable.\n(In recent years the NAEB has operated on a cash basis.\nTherefore, any money received during a given fiscal year was\ncredited to that year's income and expended within that fiscal\nyear. Thus, dues billed and received in January, although intended\nto cover the ensuing claendar year, were considered income for\nthe fiscal year starting the previous July.)"
