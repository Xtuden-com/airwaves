She submitted a detailed report to Harley and Hill in March.\nShe was then asked to prepare a precis of this report, together with her\nrecommendations, and submit it to the publications committee for their\nconsideration during their meeting at the IERT.\nThat precis is attached herewith, and the recommendations of the Publications\nCommittee will be presented orally to the Board.\nIt should be understood that to properly plblish such a magazine as is\nenvisioned the editorial staff would have to be enlarged and perhaps an agency\nwould have to be found willing to undertake the selling of advertising*\nIt would likely result in a sizeable deficit the first year or two of operation -\nperhaps $7,000 a year, or more0\nRecommendation\nAppreciating the time spent by Betty McKenzie, and respecting her\njudgement as an editor, it is still felt that this proposal has merit and\nherewith request the Boards approval to explore the matter further and ,\nif conditions warrant, to publish such e Newsletter for at least one year,\nwhile continuing to publish the Journal* but on a quarterly basis 0"
