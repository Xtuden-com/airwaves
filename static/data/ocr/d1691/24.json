URBAN\nVERSUS RURAL\nLISTENING\nThese tables are of interest, but are of less validity than for the\nBloomington survey because so few mural calls (only 134 out of 1552\ntotal calls were to rural listeners) were made in this survey. It\ndoes reflect rural listening at the times indicated (72s on Tuesday\n7-00-10:00 p.ra. etc. as listed in earlier tables) and may indicate\nsome rural reaction to variety programs.\nURBAN RURAL\nOn . * .\nOn.. ,\n37*\nOff . .\n....\n- = - 49.4*\nOff ..........\n* 63*\nBetter .\n....\n. = . 70,6*\nBetter ...... - . .\n• 71*\nWorse. „\n....\n. . - 15.4*\nworse. .......\n- 13-5*\nSame . .\n....\n- - - 14*\nSane ..........\n• 15.5*\nNetwork.\n....\n88.5*\nNetwork. ........\n92.8*\nLocal . ,\n- - - . ■\n. . . 11.5*\nLocal. ..........\n. 7.2*\nFM Ratio\n. - - 9*\nFM Ratio =\n3*\nOwn More\nThan One\nRadio 64*\nOwn More Than One Radio\n37*"
