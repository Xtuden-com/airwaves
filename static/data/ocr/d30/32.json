The programming for\nPublic Radio, if it is to survive, must reflect this.\nBut such is the mesmeric effect of commercial broadcasting, that\nonly careful preparation, energetic production and authoritative\npresentation will manage to win and hold a national audience. Once\nrecognised as a responsible and sympathetic vehicle for material\nof public interest and enjoyment (never let it be said that\npublic radio ought not to entertain), the success of a new sound\nwill undoubtedly be assured.\nDespite the fact that the supreme quality of BBC production\nmethods remains to be matched, it would be foolish to attempt\nexact reduplication of the British experience. The British\nBroadcasting Corporation has four channels and a captive, feeÂ¬\npaying, audience.\nThe Canadian situation is more capable of mutual exploration\nwith our own, yet even here there remains no doubt that the\np?H>blems and forces encountered within our turbulent amalgam must\nbe handled with new techniques of our own devising. Then, through\nrealistic programming, American Public Radio could not only build\nfor itself a viable image within the American consciousness, but\nalso, through national, and international, involvement, bring into\nfocus and define a new creative experience for our time.\nBernard Mayes"
