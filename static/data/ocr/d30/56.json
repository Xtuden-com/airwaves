The development of a program service. . .perhaps like those of\nthe wire services. . .which would provide reports and actualities to\nparticipating stations at a low cost. The availabilities might include\nrelatively current tape segment mailed out as well as contemporary\nsounding report and actuality material made available to stations by .\ntelephone. Such a service would offer currently limited stations the\nchance to program good news and information programming and to do it\nwithin current or currently developing program formats. It could\nborrow from other national broadcasting facilities,-^rom commercial\nsources where available, and from its own productions, to offer a new\ndimension in programming to currently fund-poor stations. And it\ncould do so while leaving great flexibility of program choice and\nproduction styling to the individual station.\nVI. A program for developing new series of information or\npublic service programming which would be offered to stations.\nExamples might be short, perhaps two-to-five minutes? features\non science or books on religion or even sports, done in an inÂ¬\nteresting and contemporary manner. Combined, with other programs, like\nan international press digest, they could offer.yet another program\nsource to public radio.
