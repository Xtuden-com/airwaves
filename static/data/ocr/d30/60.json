W. - Suite 630\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nEnclosed is a copy of the draft proposal of a\nquestionnaire. In fact, three are. proposed.\nThe AM form which is given in detail'. Very\nminor variations in it are contemplated for the\nFM form. This questionnaire would go to all\nFMs except the 10 watters.\nSimilar information will be sought from them^\nbut without reference to FCC forms. I antici¬\npate th© smallest percentage of response from\nthem and the least significance in their\nanswers.\nAlso enclosed is the proposed letter of trans¬\nmittal. As I said on the phone, I hope for a\ntabulation of results with some relevant com¬\nments for the November meeting of the CPB\nBoard.\nCordially yours.\nam:m\nends (2)"
