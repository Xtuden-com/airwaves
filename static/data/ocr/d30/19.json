A new network would\nfacilitate the sharing of technically improved offerings from\nusual sources in greater quantity than before, while local stations\nwould be encouraged and enabled to supply the radio needs of\nmore minorities, specialised groups and organizations than\npreviously.\n\"COMPREHENSIVE\" PROGRAMMING\nThis is both difficult and dangerous. Its aim is to cover as\nmuch as possible, for as many people as possible, for as long as\npossible, thus providing the public with a \"new sound\" and\npossibly alienating commercial media.\nIts justification is based in the premise, variously expressed,\nthat there is an unsatisfied aural need in everyone at present,\nwhich neither commercial broadcastng nor old-fashioned educational\nradio can satisfy.\nFurthermore, it is suggested that this need is far greater than\ncommercial radio would have us believe, and if satisfied might\nsoon reduce present radio to the status of background noise.\nWhatever commercial resistance there might be to public radio\nperformance based upon this premise would presumably argue for its\ntruth. Commercial radio might even eventually find itself\nplaying the supplemental role; it would certainly be challenged\nto change itself."
