C. 20036\nDear Cindy,\nThanks for your letter of the 20th.\nthat potential deadlines on this study dragged you into the\noffice on a Sunday night. But I do appreciate such dedication.\nThe medium is in good hands!\nI have begun to digest some of the material which I\npicked up from you and I am looking forward to whatever informaÂ¬\ntion the program guides will give me. I am most particularly\nlooking forward td the \"Hidden Medium\" data. I hope to come to\nWashington the week of October 7th. I shall probably drive down,\nand it occurred to me that I might be able to pick up the Land\nmaterial on Long Island (if it is still there) and bring it to\nyou. That is, if it is available and will fit in a small\nsedan. It might save shipping and handling charges and save\ntime and expense to all concerned. Let me know if it would be\nhelpful to you. I could time the trip down to fit that. If\nnecessary, I could be bonded against the chance of absconded with\nthe files and fleeing to Rio. . . . or to the commercial spies\non the other side of the kilocycle curtain.\nTell Mr. Mott that I enjoyed getting a chance to see\nhim in Chicago, that I sympathized with his wondering about\nhaving come, and especially that I would have liked to leave with\nhim. The meeting was all I feared; I only hope that the long-\nrange effects are what he hoped. I felt that anything I was\ndoing could be readily coordinated with the work done by Mr.\nMiller or the Radio Committee; and I only hope that nothing\nresults which will in any way weaken the Corporation or be\ndetrimental to public radio. I do feel that everyone concerned\nis interested in the success of the medium; and I hope that"
