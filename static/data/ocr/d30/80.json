If the gap exists — why? Is the\nlack of communication more pronounced now than it was\nten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago? Why unrest\namong the nation*s youth? What*s happening on campuses\ntoday? Is youthful militancy here to stay? Is the\ngeneration gap the fault of family deterioration, the\neducational process, the church, or other social in¬\nstitutions? Young people*s opinions on the draft,\nthe use of drugs, changing sexual codes and practices.\nAdult opinions on the same subjects. Confrontation.\nMain thrust of the series is to indicate the necessity\nof people talking with other people — even if some of\nthem are over 30 — and others under 30.\nEssay on the Country\nWith rural populations decreasing and population moving\nto great corridors (east and west coast) of the urban\nUnited States, what*s happening out there on all that\nvacated real estate? Why the migration from rural\nAmerica? What is life really like in small town America\ntoday? Is the rural American town really dying? What\nare the functions of various social institutions in rural\nAmerica today? Can anything be done to build population\nin rural and small town America? Should anything be\ndone? The city, ghetto, the suburbs have been the\nsubject for innumerable radio broadcasts. The pendulum\nshould swing toward an examination of life in rural\nAmerica — the starting point for all the urban problems\nwe*re attempting to solve today.\nLaw and Order — and Justice. Tool\nAre all three possible? Crisis in the Courts by Howard\nJames, Chief, Midwest News Bureau, The Christian Science\nMonitor.and Crime and Publicity, (the impact of news on\nthe actmini s tr at I on of justice) by Alfred Friendly and\nRonald Goldfarb might serve as departure points for a\nseries of broadcasts on what is happening to the American\njudicial system today. Canon 35, the Billy Sol Estes\nverdict and the Reardon Report isolate the judicial system\nfrom public scrutiny. Unless the American public under¬\nstands how and why our courts function as they do, justice,\nlaw and order may continue to be misunderstood — and\nunattainable*"
