Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio, NAEB\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nV/ashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nFor no valid reasons at all, I have been quite\ntardy in thanking you for your October 8th letter with\nits list of public radio stations as well as the proposal\nto Ampex. The delay does not mean we are not grate¬\nful for your keeping us so well abreast of what's going\non.\nI am under the impression that Dave Stewart may\nhave asked you for comments on the WGBH-FM Drama\nProject, once you've had a chance to hear the demo tape.\nYour opinion will be most helpful.\nI hope you realize that it is of great value to CPB\nto know that a man with an enviable track record in edu¬\ncational radio is holding down the #1 chair at NER. You\ncan be sure we'll be making a practice of ricocheting\nideas and speculations off you.\nRegards,\nRDBC/ef\nRobert D. B. Carlisle\nConsultant"
