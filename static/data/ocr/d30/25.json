Returning to a previously noted distinction, news for\npublic radio based in patch-work programming is thought of as\nnews \"in depth\" - a supplement to commercial newscasts, explaining\nand commenting upon them. Comprehensive programming, however,\nwould include all,but only, significant news drawn from a variety\nof sources - international, national, and local (if of national\ninterest), and presented in such a way as to preserve and develop\nits significance. Voyeurism would be avoided at all costs. A\nhigh standard of journalism would be essential to such presentation,\ninterpretation as such being both limited and identifiable.\nThis is not to say that incisive interpretation and commentary\n(both serious and satirical) are less essential: without these, a\ndiet of continuous significant news would be disagreeable.\nNwws might also include coverage of national and international\ndebates at times of especial public interest in them. It would\nalso && the responsibility of local program control in these\nareas (at the UN, in Congress etc.) to exten^d coverage to include\nall material of public importance, thus illuminating many\n.hitherto unnoticed yet vital fields of human affairs.\nPUBLIC AFFAIRS. All too often thought of by the younger listener\nas a variety of \"Kulture\", public affairs programs might emphasise\nthe humanity of it. all and bring to the programming as a whole\nlong needed perspectives without which news itself has no meaning.\nEssential though information is as an ingredient, it is hard\nand knobbly stuff and needs much preparation and careful serving.\nWhen an actuality interview, for example, seeks information from\nits interviewee, it is wasting time. The facts are better dealt\nwith by the interviewer himself, who permits the guest to supply\nthe more interesting \"hows\" and \"whys\"."
