Under these circumstances, it could\nbe argued that underwriting - at least the out-of-pocket costs\nof such political presentations - might well be a responsible\nobligation of the federal government.\nAt any rate, I do think Mr. Josephs1 proposal has considerable\nmerit and we would be happy to discuss it further.\nSincerely yours.\nWGHsmab\ncc: Chalmers Marquis\nRobert Mott\nWilliam G. Harley"
