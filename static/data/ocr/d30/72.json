D. Neuwirth\nof Metro Radio Sales, explains, \"Our goal is not to\nshow how to use sound effects but, rather how sound\naffects people. We feel that advertisers should know\nhow sound affects people. We want to show what people\nhear and what they react to. We want to show what\nmotivates them to buy, and we feel that the mea\nspending money in our medium want to know these ans¬\nwers too.\"\nRadio is a medium of imagination. If the creative\ntalent exists to bring imagery of an audience into\naction, financial support should be provided for\nexperimentation•\nRaymond Swing suggested, \"If the eye gets into the\nact, the mind's contribution id diluted.\"\nThe opportunity for aural experimentation in edu¬\ncational broadcasting should be encouraged."
