Mott,\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington D. C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nIn my search for information on non-commercial radio\nstations which the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\ncould use in evaluating licensees, individually and\ncombined, I have run up against a snag. I had hoped\nthat data from the annual financial reports of non¬\ncommercial stations to the FCC might be available to\nan organization such as CPB although similar informa¬\ntion on commercial stations is not a matter of public\ninformation for obvious competitive reasons. However,\nit appears that the non-commercial data is not avail¬\nable even to CPB.\nIs there some evidence of the magnitude of operations\nof NAEB, NER or NERN members available? Are any of\nthe dues or fees based upon size of operating budget?\nWhile this would not be as inclusive of licensees or\nof data, if radio members could be Identified by\nranges of operating budgets, the information might be\nvery helpful in clarifying the value of a more detailed\nquestionnaire approach.\nIf you have read the August KWSC Radio Bulletin, the\narticle on your departure would leave no doubts of the\npresence of Burt Harrison in our midst. The style was\ninimitably his.\nThanks for your gracious and most kind letter. Con¬\ntrary to one element in it, your leaving WSU to join\nNER was not against my judgment. I never double-think\nfor another on personal decisions. My principal con¬\ncern was for the effect upon the WSU training program\nin the simultaneous loss of the two recognized leaders\nin the broadcasting area.\nI hope that you and Edie are enjoying Washington D.C.\nand its environs. There are many interesting things"
