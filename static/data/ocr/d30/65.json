Holt\nPublic Radio Study\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n1384 Massachusetts Avenue\nCambridge, Massachusetts 02138\nDear Sam:\nI understand from Mr. Mott that Chicago developed\ninto a somewhat frustrating encounter. I hope that\nyou were able to sort out the problems by the time\nthe sessions ended. Prom the tone of your recent\nletter, I assume that all is well now.\nYou are more than kind to offer to bring THE HIDDEN\nMEDIUM research materials to Washington. I learned\nyesterday, however, that Railway Express already\nhas them in hand and they will hopefully arrive\nhere Monday. Past experiences serving as a guide,\nI will be very surprised if in fact they appear. But,\nI expect they should have arrived by the time of\nyour proposed trip the week of October 7. Should\nwe run into any real shipment snags, 1*11 contact you\nbefore you head this way.\nGlad to learn that you solved your personnel problem.\nWe will look forward to meeting your new assistant\nwhen you get here.\nI donft guarantee how well I might be able to teach\nboth of you, but 1*11 make every effort possible.\nWe*11 look forward to seeing you again soon.\nSincerely,\nLucinda K. Landreth\nAdministrative Assistant"
