C. to help establish National\nEducational Radio as a more effective medium in the\nreporting of government affairs.\nDevelopment\nThrough a cooperative effort involving the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters and The American\nUniversity a news and public affairs bureau staffed by\none man was established in March 1967. The program\nmaterial supplied affiliated stations included inter¬\nviews with prominent leaders such as the late Senator\nRobert F. Kennedy, Senator Everett Dirkson, Ralph\nNader, General William Westmoreland, Secretary of\nAgriculture Orville Freeman and others discussing a\nwide range of tppics of current interest. Reaction to\nthe service was favorable. Due to a limitation of\nfunds (both NAEB and The American University) the\npublic affairs program series was terminated and the\nbureau closed on June 30, 1968.\nDespite its brief life, evidence accrued that as\nenvisioned by the conferees at the Wingspread meeting,\na news and public affairs bureau for educational stations\nshould be established and supported."
