The weather has been typical —\nrecord high temperatures and exceedingly high hunidity.\nWe were managing that in good shape until last Friday\nwhen the air conditioning went out in our apartment.\n(Stop smilingI) We were saved by the swimming pool\nthrough the weekend and a delightful cool front that\nmoved in Sunday night. It was 82 yesterday and about\n78 for the high Tuesday. Delightful!\nI cannot visualize Warren Bishop in your role. He\nbelieves in a closed campus society and the flow of\ninformation will be curtailed. I am sorry it is\nhappening for the university we both love will suffer.\nSincerely,\nRAMslkl\nEnclosure\nRobert A. Mott"
