For public broadcasting to\nachieve the role contemplated by the Congress it is necessary\nthat free or substantially reduced rate service soon be made\navailable regularly during prime broadcasting hours as well\nas other hours. The Corporation is presently awaiting the\nresults of AT&T estimates of what service of eight hours per\nday in prime time seven days a week would cost, at normal\nAT&T rates, and what, if any, additional facilities might\nneed to be constructed. With these facts in hand, together\nwith the information provided by the operation of the proposed\nrule, the Corporation with other representatives of public\ntelevision will set forth to the common carriers and the\nCommission its proposal for a rate structure which would\nenable public broadcasting to fulfill its responsibilities.\nThe Proposed Rule\nWhile the ultimate decision as to what services shall be\nrequired and how the cost will be borne will require the conÂ¬\nsideration and resolution of numerous complex questions, the\nCorporation regards the presently proposed rule as a useful\nstep, beginning this process."
