  "text": "NOTES FOR AGENDA OF CONFERENCE\nThe deliberations of the conference might be broken down into\nthree specific problem areas, keyed to the following general questions\nI. What should be the role of public radio?\nII. Where in relation to this ideal role does public radio stand\ntoday?\nIII. What should be the role of the CPB in public radio?\nAn analysis of these questions should give some specific form to the\nconference. , •»\nI. WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF PUBLIC RADIO?\nThis is the crucial question for the medium, for it is the one\nwhich reflects the philosophical orientation which the medium should\ntake. In turn, the larger question can be broken down into component\nquestions:\nA. How important a role should public radio try to play in the\nAmerican scheme of radio broadcasting? Should it seek to enlarge its\nrole in radio, or should it be content to remain a relatively minor\npart of the medium? The answer to this question will determine much\nelse that is attempted.\nB. What should be the scope of public radio? Should it seek\nto provide a new national radio vehicle, or should it join commercial\nradio as a primarily local medium, responding to local needs and\ncommunities? The role, types, and aims of interconnection are vital .\nto any planning for the public medium in long-range thinking.\nC. What programming content should public radio aim to develop?\nShould it seek to work from the same basic programming format as that"
