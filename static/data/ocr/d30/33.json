Sanders My exploration of the Northwestern College Stations\nFrank E. Schooley leads me to the conclusion that their headquarters\njack Valenti are in Minneapolis at 50 Willow Street (55403).\nTherefore, the listing you have in the copy for\nyour directory for KNWS-AM-FM showing this address\nis incorrect. The zip code for Waterloo, Iowa, is 50702.\nIn the Broadcasting; Yearbook, I observe that Cornelius\nKeur appears to be the official in charge of radio for several\nstations which are operated non-commercially for Northwestern.\nIn addition to KTIS-AM-FM (Minneapolis), KNWC (Sioux\nFalls, S. Dakota - CP), and KNWS-AM-FM (Waterloo, Iowa), NorthÂ¬\nwestern was listed in Broadcasting Yearbook as licensee of KFNW-\nAM-FM in Fargo, North Dakota. These latter two stations are not\nIncluded in your copy.\nAllen Miller\nConsultant, Radio Committee\nam :m"
