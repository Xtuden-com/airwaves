This is\ncertainly an idea that is deserving of further exploration and it\nmay have great possibilities for public broadcasting, both in\nterms of increased visibility and relevance as well as quid pro\nquo for federal support. Though there may be variations on how\nsuch a plan could be put into effect, something of this nature is\ndesperately needed on behalf of the candidates for whom, as\nMr. Josephs points out, \"time has gotten out of joint.\"\nNAEB has long taken the position of encouraging its stations to\nparticipate in a program of political education. We've said so\nin public hearings before the Congress and FCC, and have said so\nin many speeches* Certainly no other aspect of education is more\nfundamental to preserving the democratic process than developing\nan informed electorate and the costs of campaigning and the time\nand energy required by candidates in \"whistle-stopping\" across\nthe country could be substantially reduced if they could appear\nbefore large numbers of people via the mass media.\nHowever, it could be argued that since the station's rationale\nis one of providing meaningful educational experiences for their\nviewers, that they already have an obligation to inform the\npublic about the qualifications of the candidates by providing\nfor their appearance over their facilities."
