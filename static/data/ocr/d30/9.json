You’ll recall we discussed\nthis when we were examining radio projects during\nour meeting in Mr. Swezey’s office.\nMy position is essentially unchanged. Radio drama\nprogram fare is virtually non-existent and would be\nutilized by many stations if available. Assuming\nthe Corporation funds as many as five projects, I\nwould urge the inclusion of the WGBH project now\nunderway.\nIt’s my judgment that the other projects we discussed\nshould remain in the tentative priorities we gave them\npreviously.\nYou’ll recall we discussed the costs of relocating\nthe NER Network facility from Urbana, Illinois to\nWashington, D. C. I do not yet have final figures\nbut it appears that the actual moving costs are not\nprohibitive. When I have gathered all costs, I’ll\nsend the Information to you as you requested.\nSorry you didn’t attend the CPB-Ford Foundation ses¬\nsion on educational radio. Stimulating — and, I\ntrust — helpful to those making the decisions.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM; Ikl"
