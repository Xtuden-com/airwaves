We h«ve had a few requests in our office\nfor the maps since a set was on display at the con¬\nvention. If distribution is possible, we would be\npleased to disseminate information regarding the\nmaps and their availability to educational radio\nstations and like organizations*\nHartford Gunn's draft proposal for a National Public\nRadio System arrived Monday. We will want to react to\nthe proposal in detail. In general, the document merits\nsupport.\nIn one of our earlier conversations I indicated that we\nhad submitted a number of proposals to the Corporation\nfor Public Broadcasting. Until decisions had been\nreached by CPB, I felt it improper to tender the pro¬\nposals elsewhere. Some time after the CPB has made\nits judgments, I would like to talk with you regard¬\ning the Ideas we have developed.\nWill you let me know regarding the distribution plan\nfor the maps?\nAgain, sorry our corridor conversation was so Brief.\nSincerely,\nRobert A.
