Holt\nDirector\nThe Public Radio Study\n1384 Massachusetts Avenue\nCambridge, Massachusetts 01238\nDear Sam;\nSometime when you aren’t busy, dredge out one\nof the Kear and Kennedy educational radio\ncoverage maps (either the combined AM-FM or the\nFM) and study the coverage indicated along the\nIdaho-Oregon border. There’s a circle of alleged\ncoverage there about half dollar size. I’ll buy\nyou lunch if you can find any station in that\narea providing FM coverage (or AM) in the area in¬\ndicated on the map.\nIt makes me wonder about the r eliability of the\nrest of the map. Wonder where that coverage really\nbelongs.\nLook forward to seeing you again and learning more\nabout your travels to educational radio land.\nRegards to Vince and best wishes for the holidays\nto you both.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:lkl"
