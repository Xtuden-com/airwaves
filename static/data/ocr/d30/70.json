C. 20036\nSeptember 5, 1968\nDear Bob:\nThanks for the data on NER memberships by annual budget\nclasses. I have used the data in less detailed form in\nwriting to CPB. Your request that the information not be\nreleased more broadly was made quite clear.\nThe digest of The Hidden Medium certainly eliminated much of\nthe fluff which appeared in the original version. I shall\nfind the data of very limited use in aiding CPB toward the\nestablishment of its goals and procedures.\nI am glad to hear that you and Edie are enjoying your experi¬\nences in Washington. My prejudices were influenced quite\nstrongly by weather. However, as you point out, man can now\ncontrol his environment to a considerable extent most of the\ntime.\nThe shakedown of the new structure is not yet complete.\nActually, details have not yet been announced officially. I\nagree with you that information on campus may become much\nharder to obtain. If so, a heavy price will be paid event¬\nually.\nGenerally, I am staying off the campus, catching up on much\nlong-neglected yard work. Bobbie and I are about to leave\non a trip to visit Gordon and his family in Denver. He has\nnot received orders but expects to be shipped to Thailand or\nVietnam in October. Then we will go on to Indiana to visit\nmy father. Hopefully, my brother will be there at the same\ntime as we are. My sister is living with my father so we\nmay have a reunion. Not many can be anticipated with Dad\napproaching 951\nAnent family statistics, Gregory and Carolyn are now proud\nparents of a boy, Douglas Allen, as well as their three\ndaughters. After our return from Indiana, we expect to go\ndown to Salem to judge the new member of the clan.\nCordially yours,\nam:m"
