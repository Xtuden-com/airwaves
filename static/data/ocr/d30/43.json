If the rule is\nto enable the Commission to gather detailed information to\nfacilitate the decision making process, it is essential that\nreports be sufficiently frequent and detailed to insure that\nthe Commission will receive a prompt and precise view of events.\nTowards this end, we would make the following specific recom¬\nmendations: (1) the rule should be expanded to require a\nreport every sixty days on all pending requests for service;\n(2) the rule should require immediate notice to the Commission\nof the denial of any requests for service; and (3) the report¬\ning that is presently contemplated by the proposed rule should\nbe on a quarterly rather than bi-annual basis. Accordingly,\nwe would urge that the rule as presently proposed be issued in\na final form substantially similar to the draft rule put foi-\nward in the Comments of the Ford Foundation filed in this\nproceeding.\nThe Notice describes the proposal of this rule as an\n\"initial step\" in the process of establishing what further\nrules and regulations are appropriate and desirable.
