Within this general question,\nhowever, some things can be used as the basis for future questionÂ¬\ning:\nA. What is the extent of public radio coverage in the\ncountry today?\nB. Can any clear idea be gained of the audience of current\npublic radio? If so, can audience figures give any indication .*\nto relative success of types of station formats or programming?\nCan better measurement techniques be devised, or new methods\ninstituted, which might be of use in public radio?\nC. Of the current problems facing public radio, which are\neasily remediable? Are they generally based upon problems of funding,\nor do some go much beyond?\nD. What categories can be devised for rating stations by\nprogramming, reach, or impact? Do such categories tell us anything\nabout types of stations and the success which they have had?\nE. What does the limited current work in interconnection tell\nus about the stations themselves, or about the future impact of\ninterconnection? Is any basic trend for interconnection efforts\nindicated?\nF. What can the situation of specific communities tell us about\nrelative patterns of success or impact for public radio? Do the\ncommunity patterns indicate further anything about the relationships\nbetween public radio and TV?"
