  "text": "The art of Instantaneous recording has advanced so rapidly\nin the past few years that today standards for recording equipment\na tf)\nare on- fcfcsxxauRK level withy other reproducing equipment. No longer\ncan the recorder employ hit and miss methods in determining the\ncharacteristics of his recording equipment. Much has been written\nin the past in Electronics1 and other technical publications concerning\nthe light pattern method of determining the frequency response character¬\nistics. Less has been written concerning methods of determining\namplitude distortion using the same method. In either case it is\nnecessary to know what power level is represented by the widths of\nthe various hands. Fig 1. is a photograph of the iijstSfcxfeHnd of a\nfrequency response pattern aixax .
