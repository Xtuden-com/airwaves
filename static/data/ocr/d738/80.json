  "text": "the printed picture will not be the same as those scaled from\nthe original but the frequency response curve will be exactly\nsimilar*\nIn a like manner the amplitude character!sties of a recording\nhead can be obtained* At any given frequency, record a group of\nband$ each band representing a definite increase over the previous\nband, say in 3 DB steps* Then by plotting the input as abscissas\nand the outputs, scaled from the light bands on the record, as\nordinates, an amplitude response curve can be obtained. Any\ndeparture from linearity indicates the presence of amplitude\ndistortion in the recording system."
