While the results have not\nyet been tabulated, I thought perhaps you might be interested\nin a general statement concerning performance of the machines\nIn our hands.\nThe 16 RC model had a very nice frequency char¬\nacteristic, increasing regularly from 100 to 5000 cycles\nand then dropping at essentially the same rate from 5000\nto 10,000 cycles. The level at 10,000 cycles was essentially\nthe same, or possibly a little higher than the 1000 cycle\nlevel. The 5000 cycles was approximately 8 decibels above\nthe 1000 cycle level.\nThe turntable of this machine was .3 percent. The\nother two models showed a peak at 2000 cycles and considera¬\nbly less high frequency response. The turntable stability\nfor these -twowmodels was .7 percent for the 12 RC and a.\n.5 percent for the 12 RP.\nThe other data on these machines has not been\ncollected. You will, of course, receive a complete report\non your Machine along with a report on the other machines.\nThe tests were conducted as per the specifications except\ninsofar as follows:\nUnder the Method of Making Tests—\nla. During the \"tests some machines wwre enoountired\nwhich would record only at 78 RPM on a maximum\ndisc size of 12 inches. On these machines cuts\nwere made at a diameter of 8 inches at a speed\nof 78 RFM.\nlb. This section was deleted and standard recording\nlevel was taken as that level recommended by the\nmanufacturer. It was pointed out to the committee\nthat the machines in service would in all proba¬\nbility be operated at this level and therefore"
