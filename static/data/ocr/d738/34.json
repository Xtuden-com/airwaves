We feel that this\nwill increase the accuracy of the measure¬\nments many fold. Also the relationship\nbetween recorded level and the width of\nthe pattern was ohedked using the rela¬\ntions given in Appendix 3.\n3b. This cut was eliminated and the stabil¬\nity was determined from the noise level\ncut made under 2a which was extended\nsomewhat.\n3b. This test was altered as follows: The\nbeats between the recorded note and the\nstandard were oounted and the turntable\nstability^ was stated in percent age\nvariation. This, of oourse, alters 3.\nAs stated in the speoifloAtlons, we should\nlike to have a comment from the manufacturer,\ngiving his opinion regarding the validity of these\ntests and his suggestions. Since the report is\nnow in the process of preparation, I would appre¬\nciate your comments, if any, at the earliest\npossible moment.\nI want to thank you for the efforts you\nput forth in obtaining the machine for these\ntests. Please send me shipping instructions.\nTours very truly\nA. James Ebel\nNAEB Recording Committee\nChairman\nAJE:EH"
