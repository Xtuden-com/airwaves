This ohart was developed to\nfacilitate measurements on recording machines being\nmade by the recording committee of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters. It has\nworked very nicely on the fifteen different recordÂ¬\ning machines which we have had occasion to test.\nThe curve of Fig. 2 was scaled from the\npicture, but was reduoed to a basis of 1000 cyoles\nequals aero level by dividing the 1000 cycle width\ninto the other band widths.\nI sincerely hope you will be able to use\nthis ohart. I firmly believe it is a necessity\nfor the recorder.\nYours very truly.\nA. James Ebel\nChairman\nNAEB Recording Committee\nAJEs eh\nEno."
