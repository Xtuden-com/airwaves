Under Item Vb, this suggestion is also a good\none and shall be incorporated.\nAgain I want to express my appreoiation'for the\neffort you have put forth in this matter, and should I\npass through Iowa City in the near future 1*11 look you\nup so that this material might be more fully discussed.\nI realize that the tests we are conducting are i ^\nfar from ideal. It is only the first step toward obtaining\nsome sort of standardization in this particular field. I\nthink the experience we will obtain from making these\ntests will be invaluable in proposing new standards of\nmore complete tests on instantaneous recording equipment.\nYours very truly,\nAJEjEH\nA.
