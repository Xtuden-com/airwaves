Eng.\nRadio Station WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Ebel:-\nThank you for the courtesies extended to our Mr. C.V.\n•taring on his recent visit to your University.\nHe informs us that complete tests were conducted several\ndays ago and we hope you found everything satisfactory. The equip¬\nment Mr. Kettering had with him is a demonstrator with our latest\nimprovements incorporated on it. The new production machines which\nare now in final assembly are considerably better from a mechanical\nstandpoint and we have improved the cutter network. We have succeeded\nin eliminating the slight peak which was present in the equipment\nu used for testing. There is no change in the cutterhead itself as\nis is accomplished entirely by the network which is being incor-\nrated in the production machine. The introduction of this network\nso enables us to introduce a slight peak at 10,000 cycles. This\nves assurance of a gradual rising characteristic on the high end\nd which we have found to be desirable. The peak at 10,000 cycles\nabout 3 db above reference at a 1,000 cycles.\nIn addition to this new model recorder, we are expanding\nour line of equipment and no doubt Mr. Kettering explained to you\nthe new Unit 227 Transcription Turntable, the 245 Pre-amplifier\nEqualizer and the Unit 246 Amplifier. In stations where we have in¬\nstalled our transcription turntables, we are receiving most gratify¬\ning reports as to the exact turntable performance and constant ser¬\nvices these tables are giving. If you have any plans for installing\ntranscription turntables in the near future we wish you would give\nour Unit 227 every consideration.\nAgain, we wish to thank you for the courtesies extended\nto our Mr. Kettering and if at any time we can be of assistance to"
