  "text": "a pickup device will, when playing the recording represented by\n(1) above, generate a voltage which Is given by\nE = KP^ (2)\nwhere\nE : voltage generated by pickup device\nKp a transformation constant of pickup device\nSince N is essentially constant during the recording the constants\nmay be combined and (2) written as\nE = KW (3)\nwhere K represents the combination of all the constants in (2)*\nIf width, W0, gives rise to a voltage, E0, then the constant,\nE, may be evaluated as follows\nTherefore, the voltage generated by any width band may be expressed\nin terma of E0 and W0. Assuming for width Wc zero level output,\nwe can express the output in DB represented by any other lightband\nwidth.\nRecorded level (DB) 20 log W0 (5)\nThe accompanying chart shows the plot of this function\nwhen zero level equals one centimeter. It might be well to point\nout here that the chart is also valid, for zero level equals one\ninch if the ordinates are taken as inches Instead of as centimeters\nIt is not necessary, of course, that the 1000 cycle value be at\nzero level since a frequency response curve can be drawn at any\nlevel.\nThe curve in Fig. 2 was taken from the pattern in Fig. 1.\nSince the picture was reduced in printing the levels scaled from"
