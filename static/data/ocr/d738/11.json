I might\nmention that I found it desirable to make two\nchanges: 1. In determining the frequency\nresponse pattern I find that it is more aoourate\nto compare the amplitude pattern and the fre¬\nquency pattern by means of photographs rather\nthan using calipers. 2. An addition to de¬\ntermining turntable stability, count the number\nof beats between the playback 1000 cycle tone\nand the oscillator 1000 cycle tone, and that\nwill give you stability in parts per thousand.\nThis presumes of course that the oscillator\nstability is much greater than that of the\nturntable.\nI haven’t heard any news recently concerning\nthe new transmitter and antenna set-up. How\nabout sending along a little?\nBest regards.\nVery truly yours,\nA. James Ebel\ntt&r"
