Sampling instruments\nwill be pre-tested in representative situations before launching the general research\neffort, scheduled for March.\n- The Ad Hoc Committee plans to send a delegation to visit Commissioner Keppel,\nUSOE, to urge that he take an active role in the copyright deliberations. It is also\nlikely that a delegation will pay a second call upon the Register of Copyrights at an\nearly date.\n- Several Federal agencies have been asked by the Register to express their views\non the proposed revisions of the copyright law. The Department of Defense (which\nmakes extensive use of audio-visual materials and television in its training centers),\nthe FCC, and HEW are all preparing statements.
