Beginning with the January 1957 issue,\nthe regular NAEB Newsletter is to be printed. This may help us to get these\nquarterly issues out more promptly, at least we hope so. In the printed version\ntoo, we shall be able to use photographs and line drawings which will enable us\nto illustrate articles more easily.\nWe have in preparation a paper on a two channel all transistor remote mixer-\namplifier, designed and built by Donald K. Haahr of the staff of WOI at Iowa State\nCollege. This will be mailed to you separately since it will probably not be\nready to go with this Newsletter. We also have in preparation a paper by E. D.\nGoodale of the National Broadcasting Company on phase, amplitude and aperture\ncorrection in television systems. This will be sent only to ETV stations and\nstudios and to others upon request.\nWork has been started on the revised Technical Directory. Many failed to\nreturn the forms sent to our mailing list on November 26. We don’t want to leave\nanyone out so we’re including these forms as the last page of this News-letter.\n.lease fill out both sides of this page as we need both directory data and test\nequipment information. Thanks.\nr\nCSB:dfc\nCecil S. Bidlack\nJanuary 9, 1957"
