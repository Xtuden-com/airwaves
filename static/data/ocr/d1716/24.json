  "text": "-25-\nTime An Important Factor, Says Gould\n\"As outlined by the Regents,\" continued Gould, \"the entire cultural resources of the\nstate—college3c, schools, libraries, museums, medical institutions, art galleries, etCo\nwould be utilized to provide programming both in the school and at home and for adults\nas well as children,. Such programming would supplement, not displace, the efforts of\nthe commercial broadcasters#\n\"But the critical issue confronting the board5s plan is one of timee The Federal\nCommunications Commission is scheduled to act this spring or summer on the reserva¬\ntion of channels necessary for such educational purposes# Many of these channels also\nare sought by commerical interests# If the world of education does not take positive\nsteps within a year's time, to enter TV, it will lose an opportunity which may not\ncome again for years, if ever®\n\"Senator Quinn and Assemblyman Steingut specifically have introduced a resolution ask¬\ning that the Legislature indorse the plans of the Regents and urge the F® Co Co to\nreserve the required channels0 Clearly, that is what must be done if the F» Co Co\nIs to have tangible grounds on which to set aside valuable frequencies®\nSome Urge Delay\n\"In contrasty Senator Walter To Mahoney, Republican, who is chairman of the Senate\nfinance committee, has taken the view that no action can be taken either by the\nRegents or the Legislature until after the Fo C® Co has made a reservation This\napproach completely overlooks the practical fact that if nobody asks for the channels,\nwhy should the F® Co Co reserve them?\n\"The Quinn-Steingut resolution does serve the useful purpose of providing a focal\npoint around which the many proponents of educational TV can organize supporto Some¬\nhow it must be impressed upon the Republican leadership that the extension of the\neducational processes into millions of homes, which the invention of television now\nmakes possible, is an opportunity and challenge which transcends party considerations\nor affiliationse The issue of educational TV must be met, not avoided, in Albany®\"\nFUN WITH SPEECH BEGAN BY KUSD\nAnother series of broadcasts to elementary school classrooms was begun in January by\nKUSD, University of South Dakota radio station, Keith Nighbert, manager announced8\nCalled, \"Fun with Speech,\" the series is heard each Friday at 3§l£ p«m®\nThe new series was prepared by Allis Rice, director of the KUSD School of the Air, in\ncooperation with Mrs® Ethel Bridgeford Groat, who Is in charge of the speech and hear¬\ning conservation program of the division of crippled children of the South Dakota State\nDepartment of Health® Together they prepared a teacher's manual which has been distri¬\nbuted to elementary teachers about the state®\nMrs® Groat, in a letter to the teachers, states that the radio program was planned in\nan effort to provide training in the field of speech to South Dakota school children®\nShe says that the radio program is not couplete in itself but that it supplements what\nthe teacher is able to do for her students®\nThe program is designed to do in a fifteen-minute broadcast as much as possible to\nhelp eliminate much of the maladjustment in speech of children in the classroom, eli¬\nminate as many failures as possible and provide an enriched experience in the train¬\ning of the essential art of speech®"
