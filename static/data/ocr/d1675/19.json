Most of them are in perfect health today, and better\noff than any other class of Americans, yet already they get more relief\nthan anybody else.\nAnd now a two-billion dollar bonus besides, to be paid right away\nanything else?\nWishing you a very merry Christmas, I am\nYours very sincerely,\nHHCsCC\nDirector,"
