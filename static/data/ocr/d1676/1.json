That means that we\nwould like to have not only the largest number of stations\nrepresented, but also that we would like to see two or\nmore present from each station. It strikes us that our\nchief operators, our program directors, and others, will\nget a point or two that will justify the time and expense\nnecessary to make the trip.\nSeveral topics have been suggested for discussion.\nThese will be arranged in program form, possibly to\noccupy the mornings, while the afternoons will doubtless\nbe given over to round table discussions. I want to\npoint out however, that the program will not be so formal\nas to bring discomfort or displeasure to those attending.\nWe will attempt to run the two days to meet the desires\nof the greatest number.\nMay I ask your utmost cooperation to make the\nmeeting a success?\nCordially yours,\n5\nJoe Wright"
