  "text": "My good friend Ted Eeaird of the University of Oklahoma makes the point that the\nmoney supplied in financing University radio stations comes from the tax payers pockets.\n\"Like all institutions of higher learning,” he savs, ”we are striving to serve the\npatrons of this state in an educational activity using sound educational policy. We\nall know that radio is one of the principal factors in oresenting educational material\nto our constituency and I think we all agree,” he continues, ’’that $1,000 spent in\npromoting the work of an educational radio station will go as far as $10,000 in the\ncommercial field, because we have the natural facilities, talent, etc., already con¬\ntracted and paid for, the same not appearing as an item of cost for radio broadcasting’!\nProfessor Brackett*Uirector of Station KUSD, points out that ’’nothing has ever\nbeen paid for anything broadcast by this station, uffioe and correspondence is charged\nto general administration, no rental is charged for the rooms used and there is no\ncharge to radio for heat, light, and power used. The only thing charged directly to\nradio operation is $1800 per year to the Director of Radio as part of his salary* in\npayment of that portion of his work as the general administrative official and tech¬\nnical director of the station.’*\nThese three instances - Illinois, Oklahoma, and South Dakota - are the true\npicture of educational broadcasting as it concerns the charges for cost and operation.\nI want to make the point again that just because the budget ”set-up” for educa -\ntional institutions allows radio broadcasting to go forward without any great expendi¬\nture of money, it is no criterion that its programs are consequently of corresponding¬\nly low grade.\nYours very truly.\nJos. F. Wright, President."
