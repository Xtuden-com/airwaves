Tears of work conld he devoted to making good the deficiencies\nof commercial radio alone. Programs for children, designed to interest them\nin other subjects than those of murder, crime, and detection; the still unanswered\ncraving for helpful info mat ion on health; democracy in action and on trial;\nservice to non-orofit organisations; history; science, and art; the new problems\nof the global family of nations—\"the list Is endless.\nIt is most desirable that the center be quickly self-supporting. An initial\ngrant-ln-aid from one of the Foundations ai^it be sougit. Salaries and production\ncosts not being high, a quick return is likely on the sale of transcriptions, A\nmodest annual subscription from member stations in the public service field would\nprovide a steady revenue. With the center organized on a notrr. nfit basis, the\nbudget could probably be easily balanced. A favorable balance would go to the\nincrease of staff and production. Training courses for students, in writing and\nproduction for radio, could be organised and would provide an added source of\nrevenue. The growth of IN public service stations will necessitate such training.\nThe danger of which we must continuously warn ourselves is that of dispersed,\ndiluted effort. A pooling of the best talent available Is the soundest Insurance\nof the program quality that will be needed.\nSuch are components of the plan for the future, first tracings of a blue¬\nprint that others can improve and elaborate. Our purpose has bean to show that\nradio’s third estate can and must come into Its own. But to do so it must\norganize."
