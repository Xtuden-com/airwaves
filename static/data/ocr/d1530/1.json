LIKE EVERY OTHER BROADCASTER, WE HAVE\nTOC WORRY ABOUT FM, ABOUT DAYTIME BROADCASTING, ABOUT UHF-VHF.\nLL All of THESE activiTIES ARE enjoyable to me, BUT WHAT IS more\nIMPORTANT, I BELIEVE, IS THAT NAEB CAN MAKE AND IS MAKIN$ MANY DEFI¬\nNITE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING\nIN THE USA. AT LEAST, THIS IS ALWAYS MY GOAL.\nIncidentally, fall isn’t far away. When it comes you’ll be\nHEARING ABOUT SOME PROGRAM PLANS THAT WILL GIVE ALL AN OPPORTUNITY\nTO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING OEFINITE TO THE NETWORK PROGRAMMING. PLANS\nARE IN FORMATIVE STAGES, WHICH THE PROGRAM PLANNING COMMITTEE WILL\nHAVE TO CHECK AND PASS ON, BUT 1 BELIEVE YOU’LL'WELCOME THE OPPOR¬\nTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. MORE ABOUT THE PLANS LATER.\nI REMIND ALL AGAIN OF THE NATIONAL CONVENTION DATES, OCTOBER\nl6-l8, in Atlanta. Haskell Boyter and Ken Christiansen have been\nBUSY PERSONS THESE DAYS, WORKING ON OUR BEHALF FOR A GOOD PROGRAM.\nBetter mark the dates down, and start planning now if you haven’t\nALREADY DONE SO.\nMeanwhile, you can count on lots of work by\nCOMMITTEE MEMBERS. I BELIEVE WITHIN THE LAST THR\nAMPLE, WE’VE HEARD FROM EVERY REGIONAL DIRECTOR.\nITSELF. I KNOW OF THE WORK DONE AND BEING DONE B\nMiTTEES. This all SPEAKS well for the real inter\nIN THE WORK OF THE ASSOCIATION. I BESPEAK MY THA\nYOUR OFFICERS AND\nEE WEEKS, FOR EX-\nTHAT SPEAKS FOR\nY A NUMBER OF COM-\nEST OF EVERY NAEBER\nNKS TO ALL OF YOU.\nNOW FORGIVE ME, l MUST RUSH ALONG.TO A\nIllinois baseball game and get ready for a\nHope you’re all busy too. My very best to\nttend the Ohio State-\nsquare dance tonight."
