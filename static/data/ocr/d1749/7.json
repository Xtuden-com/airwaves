Salt is tde major inorganic\nconstituent of blood serun^ and delps regulate tae neutrality of tde\nbody. Its loss from tde body leads to dehydration and circulatory in-\na\nefficiency with resulting condition of easy fatigue. These Cases\nA trU\ndevelop a salt hunger which automatically results in^ replacement\nof the salt contentjof the body. Great perspiration,\nand the development of acid or alkaline condition of the body results\nin the loss of salt from the body, Th^upplyihg of an^ abundance of\nsalt hastens the restoration of these cases to the normal condition*\nSalt is the factor in the body fluids that most clearly records our early\nancestral environment in the Cretaceous Sea. In the 400,000,000\nf/60 years that have elapsed since our ancestors ventured on dry land\nthe salt content of the ocean has almost tripled, but man and the other\nmammalian forms still carry the same salt content in the blood and other\nbody fluids. An interesting example of tne importance of salt was\ndemonstrated in the early part of this century. Weljh miners in the\ndeeper workings perspired freely and lost much more salt from their\nbodies than was being replaced in the dietary# Since the body cannot\nmake blood without salt, the volume of the b^lood was decreased and\nthe circulation of the blood become fat Inefficient, interfering with\nthdir capacity for work ana frequently resulting in fainting or collapse\nwhile at work. The large amounts of water which they consumed resulted\nin the further loss of salt from the body. A small amount of salt added\nto the drinking water restored the salt content of the blood, increased\nthe volume of the blood and the circulatory efficiency, and restored\nto these men the capacity fonproductive work."
