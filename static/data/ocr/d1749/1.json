We still need tne sane minerals\nbut do not have available the same abundant supply. Let us con-\nsome of these minerals Smdivi&ually*\nCalcium, or lime^is the material from which our bones and teeth\nare formed. It is also important in the functioning of the heart,\nmuscles and internal organs. The blood contains 0.01;C of this val¬\nuable element, and, if the concentration of calcium in blood s.iould\nfall to 0.006/b, death in convulsions occurs*\nMany different substances have been used to form the supporting\nstructures of various living forms* Cellulose, a^curbohydrute\nsubstance, formed from wgter and carbon dioxide gas, is used as a\nstructural component by plants. It may also be formed from the\ncarbohydrate or sugar foodstuffs which are so abundant in the plant\nworld. Had our evolutionary ancestor selected tixls as a source of\nmaterial for the structural unit of the skeleton, we would al¬\nways have had an abundant supply of building material for our bones.\nChitin, a compound similar to cellulose, but containing nitrogen, is\nuse by fungl^ insects, and some shell fish as a building material\nfor the firmer structures of their bodies."
