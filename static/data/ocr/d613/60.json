We know this because many\nadults (some of them wives of college professcrs) told us so.\nSecondly, thousands of persons whose education stopped with the eighth grade\nhelp support this radio station through their taxes. To my way of thinking, they're\nentitled to something for their money. If we have to sugar-coat our programs a\nlittle_or a lot-in order to raise their cultural level I say bring on the sweeten¬\ning.\nI don't delude myself into thinking that the mission of educational radio is\nto make Einsteins of us all. Why should I—or anyone-expect radio to do something\nin a decade or fifty years that the universities of this country haven't been able\nto do in over three centuries? If WNAD can teach one person one thing each day,\nwe've made progress. The founding of such state supported institutions as the\nUniversity of Oklahoma and the University of Illinois was accomplished on the premise\nthat everyone who can make the grade is entitled to a college education, not just\nthose with baccalaureate degrees. . .oijk million dollars in the bank.\nI realize that this brief treatise will not be popular with many of my colleagues.\nI know frcm experience that many of them also think we should wrap educational radio\nin aluminum foil to keep it from spoiling and allow an occasional peek inside only\nto the chosen. But it is also my feeling that the minority point of view has a place\non this panel."
