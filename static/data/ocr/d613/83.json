Miles\nDirector\nRadio Station WBAA\nPurdue University\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Jimt\nAfter getting your letter about tbs billing for the mailing labels, I\nwaited until both Harry and I were in the office to take any action.\n(Up until yesterday I hadn’t seen Harry since August 5, due to both of\nus being gone quite a bit.)\nMe have now talked this matter over and decided that I acted rather hastily\nand that we should not bill you for the labels, since you are actually\nperforming a service forus rather than vice versa.\nThe girl who does the billing isn’t in the office right now, but I don’t\nthink I had asked her to bill you as yet. However, in case you do get a\nbill, just send it back to me and I'll have it cancelled.\nSorry to have appeared ungrateful for your services, past and present - we\nreally appreciate all you are doing to help the operation here.\nRegards to Elizabeth and Ricky. Incidentally, am enclosing the $1.00 you\nloaned me at the July 4th celebration. Am embarrassed that it has slipped\nmy mind until now. At any rate, belated thanks, and I trust my credit\nrating isn't too badly impaired.\nRegards,\nHEHjjy\nEnclosure\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
