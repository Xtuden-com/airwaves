Miles, Chairman\nnaeb Pnb\\io Relations Committee_\nRadio Station WBAA '\nPurdue University\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Jims\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter I recently received from Graham Hovey. He\nrefers to -Letter Ho. 11 in the current series- of LETTER FROM ITALY. (The\nNAEB number will be Program #52.) The program is something of a special\nevent, and I've been asked to call your attention to it* You may have\nsome ideas on promoting it and making some PR use of it.\nWe hope to get the program early enough next week that it can go out with\nnext Wednesday's shipment (Issue #2, 1955)} if it doesn't come that soon,\nwe'll surely get it out with the next shipment (Issue #3).\nEach station will get the program in two forms, both at 7i ips. One will\nbe the complete original version which will run about I6i05. The other\nwill be cut to about 14:45* I contemplated sending the program at 15 ips.,\nas Graham suggests, but decided against it. Some stations will prefer it\nat Tj- and, I fear, skip it if it comes at the faster speed. Some will\nprefer the faster speed. But if we send out four different recordings of\nthe seme program, I foresee confusion, slings, arrows, etc.\nI'll let you know when the program actually goes into the mail.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager\nJHtjy\nEnclosure"
