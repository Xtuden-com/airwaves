Miles\nRadio Station WBAA\nPurdue University\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Jim*.\nGlad that you have been able to make good use of the gummed labels we\nsent, and I wish I could automatically supply you with the two additional\nsets you request. However, as you can well imagine, we are at a point\nwhere we have to try to make as many operations pay for themselves as pos¬\nsible. In recent months we have been billing members for extra copies\nof publications, addressed envelopes, etc. We have hated to do this but\nit has been necessary.\nTherefore, in order to cover our costs of preparing the addressed labels,\nwe ought to have $2.£0 per set. If it is possible for you to pay for such\nservice, would it be satisfactory to bill you for $5 for the two sets?\nIn case you are unable to do this, we will have to let it go, but we would\nprobably be unable to supply any in the future. I am having the two sets\nyou request prepared and they will be sent to you even though you are un¬\nable to pay for it.\nDorothy and I had certainly counted on coining to Lafayette to see Elizabeth,\nRicky and you before school started, but what with a one-week fishing trip\nand the fact that I have to make a week long trip starting next Monday,\nIfm afraid we won91 be able to get there. We still might count on coming\nfor a Sunday sometime in September. We9ll see.\nCordially,\nHEHscr\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
