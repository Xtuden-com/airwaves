Anderson\nProduct News\nMinnesota Mining &\nManuf scturing Coapany\nGeneral Offices\n900 Fauquier Avenue\nSaint Paul 6, Minnesota\nDear Rom\nMe have gone over the stories and done some marking up. Beyond\nthis, a few additional observations need making* *Hbh as we like 3M, and\nthough most of our tape has been Scotch, I*m sure we could not go along\nwith a statement that itfs a \"Scotch^ tape network, or that we use your\ntape exclusively, as one spot states*\nIn some cases, we*d appreciate having \"Tape Network0 changed to read\n\"Radio Network\" (by tape), since by Board action the network*s official\nname is now the \"NAEB Radio Network.\"\nIn a couple of cases (see p* 2 of long story) some figures will need\nchecking before release, and I haven* t had time to dig out the original\nfigures.\nWe do feel that too much publicity about any one person or station\nshould be avoided, since this should be a story about an organisation which\nhas seen many individuals and stations, at various times, move into and out\nof the driver’s seat or position of leadership* It*a an old and stable asso¬\nciation which owes much to many, but not everything to anyone.\nI hope this finds wide reception*\nAttached is identification of the persons in the picture. It*s also\nO.K. to go ahead with your distribution of photostats of the Wayne Oliver\nAP story, of course*\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skoraia\nExecutive Director\nHJStcr\nGCi Schooley\nHill\nEnci 3"
