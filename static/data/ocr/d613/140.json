The^Sh\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION\nof\nEDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\nJ\"\nlight-hearted history of educational broadcasting\nreplete with satires on educational radio, spoofs of foundations, take-offs on NAEB\nactivities, and graphic depictions of the struggles of educational television. Sig¬\nnificantly, this will be the first opportunity for talent from the affiliated stations\nto work together on a joint production. This is where you come in.\nI need to gather suggestions from everybody in NAEB on possible talent and material\nfor such a show. In nearly every shop there are people who do comedy routines,\nimitations, monologues, satirical skits, etc. I want to know about them - right\naway - as a means of assembling a show. I’m certain there's a wealth of talent -\nthe problem is to learn about it.\nSince this will be about broadcasting for an audience of broadcasters, the material\nshould be somewhat related; talent, though if its good enough, can be worked in\nno matter what the shape or variety. I confess I'm not strong on musical sawa,\njugglers, or talking dogs; but anything else goes.\nIf you have somebody on your staff who you think can contribute to such a show,\nplease let me know at once. Just scribble on the back of this sheet and pop it in\nthe return mail.\nIncidentally, if you have any historic photographs of NAEB old timers taken back\nin their salad days or group pictures of early conventions, etc., send them along, too.\nWe have the opportunity to put on a great show and with your cooperation I'm sure\nwe will.\nYours, truly.\nBill Harley\nProducer\nReturn to: Bill Harley\nWHA-TV\n600 North Park Street\nMadison 6, Wisconsin"
