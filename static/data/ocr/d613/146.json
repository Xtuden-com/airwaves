Sulzer, Dir*\nRadio-TV\nIndiana Univ.\nBloomington, Ind.\nDear Brorao:\nEnclosing your nice questionnaire, all dutifully filled out, as\nbefits a co-member of the PR Committee.\nNow that I've helped you, I'm asking a return favor:\nwaddahell is the Promotion Fact Sheet?\nJim Miles asked me to prepare some kind of a column for the News¬\nletter along the lines of the \"Publicity and Public Relations\"\nthings I did a year or so ago. I hope this does not overlap your\nwork. More to the point, I suspect we ought to explore some way of\nhaving our respective opuses (opi?) support each other.\nI'm getting ready to do the first column now, aiming at a Decerrber\n13 deadline. My inclination has been to solicit the members for\n\"PR Problems\" -— which I might then circulate among our Committee\nfor suggested solutions, using the response so-gained for future\ncolumns.\nYour present survey ought to reveal interesting info on NAEB P/R\nwork. Could you send me SOONEST some additional info regarding\npurposes, function, etc? Info I might use in the December article\nas a reminder to the membership to fill out the survey & send it to\nyou.\nHope to hear from you shortly.\n'gards,\ns/t/Bill Bender"
