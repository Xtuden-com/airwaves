Maybe the whole idea will prove a bust*\nI think probably that I might be able to get out a pretty complete\nstudy regarding the public relations situation in general of our educa-\ntional stations, and it might be worthwhile for the NAEB to consider\nreproducing this entire study for distribution to the membership. I\nhaven’t said anything to Jim about this, but I am shooting him a copy\nof this letter. After all, the survey is pretty useless unless we\nmake its contents known to our membership*\nI could just picture you on Thanksgiving Day. I did the same so now\nI am starting a rigorous two weeks diet*\nGive my best to Dorothy.\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGS/cdm\ncc: James S. Milgg\nDirector, WBAA"
