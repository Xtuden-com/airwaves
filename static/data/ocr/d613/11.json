Skornia\n119 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUTbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI have your several letters of July 14th and\nJuly 12th*\nThank you for sending the copy of the letter\nfrom Paulu. I have just received another one from him\nenclosing a copy of the jstory he did for \"The Listener\".\nI think that this is^sTFSprinting the \"NAEB Newsletter\",\nand I am enclosing it herewith.\nInsofar as Prix Italia is concerned, I have re¬\nceived one entry from Earl Wynn. I have not had a chance\nto listen to it as yet, but we have another two weeks be¬\nfore the stuff has to be shipped. If you can get a fast\nwire out to half a dozen of leading possible contributors,\nby all means, do so. s_\nInsofar a3 releases are concerned, I have always\nseen to it that copies are sent to you. I cannot understand\nwhy there should be any question of your not getting same.\nInsofar as NAKTB is concerned, I think that your\nreply is a perfectly valid one. If you think that I ought\nto write to John Smith, I’d be happy to. After all, these\nstudies are not designed to knock anybody on the head. I\ndo not believe that our release indicated that in any way.\nIt merely reported facts.\nI hope every effort can be made to get Hill,\nHolt and as many other members of the staff as possible to\nthe Convention. In a way, I think that this is rather vital.\nI cannot at this time promise any financial support for this,\nbut I am hopeful that our Exhibit is going to bring us out\nof the Convention with some financial plus signs. At any\nevent, please give a good hard look-see at the entire situation\nbefore a decision is made not to have them In New York.\nM Tlie Voice Of Tlie City"
