I*m very\nhappy that you called our attention to this matter. Frankly,\nit had bothered me without my realizing why. I found myself\ndigging for those dates several times and finally wrote them\ndown in a conspicuous place so that I would not have to hunt\nso far when the next announcement came out. Xou, of course,\nsee the answer in the first place.\nBy copy of this letter I'm calling the matter to Harold Hill's\nattention. As you suggest I'm sure its Just an over-sight\nand it does take guys like you to call us up when these\nmistakes are made.\nSpeaking of the convention, will we get a chance to see you there?\nI'm hopeful that we can at least get together and chat briefly\non the public relations problem while we are there. However,\nat this moment I have no formal agenda for a committee meeting\nin mind, just a gab fest if the opportunity presents itself*\nSincej^ly,\n-Jaihes S. Miles\nDirector, WBAA\nJ3K;nk\ncc: Harold Hill"
