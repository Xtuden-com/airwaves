PROGRAM DIRECTOR\n10 December 195^\nDear Roz:\nYes, the ”Air Force” article was the last one I wrote,\nbut I haven*t seen it in print. I wondered if it had been\ntoo far 11 off-trail* or whether space limitations had killed\nit for the time being? Or was it printed and I missed it?\nI note you*ve received some queries on P/R from some\nmembers. If you want to send these to me on loan, they\nmight serve as the basis for one or more articles in the\nfuture.\nYour summary in the last issue of some of the publicity\nactivities going on around the brotherhood was a good one.\nHope more material keeps coming it.\nGot an idea for a piece on \"Open Houses” which I'll\nsend you next.via Jim Miles.\nBest-"
