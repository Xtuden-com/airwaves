It was distributed in advance,\nexclusively to NAEB members^ so you would have time to make\nuse of it in whatever manner best suited your purpose.\nIf this material wound up in your wastebasket instead\nof in the columns of your local newspapers, you have missed\nan excellent chance for publicity.

Use the\nfine stories the Lowell Institute provided, and adapt them\n(MORE)"
