Dibblei\nTour letter of May 3 to Mr. Frank Schooley, NAEB President, has\nbeen referred to this headquarters.\nWe are certainly enthusiastic about the opportunity to have an\nexhibit at the animal ACPRA Convention to be held in Chicago.\nHowever we have a few questions. We would not be in a position\nto pay for exhibit apace and are wondering whether such a fee\nis charged.\nThe natter of supervision presents sons problem. Because it\nis highly unlikely that we would be able to provide supervision\nfor the duration of the Convention, and because we feel that\nsome sort of supervision is necessary, I am wondering if you\naiight suggest any one or two days daring the Convention which\nmight be the most valuable in case we decided to have an ex*\nhibit for only a part of the time.\nIt*s possible after we have more information that we may deÂ¬\ncide supervision is not essential and since our exhibit Is sasy\nto put up ms appreciate your offer to install it*\nMay I hear from you on this matter at your earliest convenience.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nBRHtor\nGCt H. 4. Skorsta*^"
