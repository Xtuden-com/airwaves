We’ve got the most useful, the most beneficial\nproduct in the world. Let’s push it. I don’t know any commercial\nbroadcasters who are afraid of competition. If you do, it’s time\nsomeone told them they’re in the wrong business. Radio and television\nare the most competitive fields I can think of. It’s no business for a\nlazy man or a coward. Anyone who can't stand the gaff should take his\nbottle of bicarb, his ulcer pills and retire permanently in the foothills\nof Vermont.\nPersonally, we’re selling education down here (or trying to), and every¬\nbody likes it from the President of the University right on down the\nline. Even the commercial boys are getting on the band wagon. Sure,\nit takes a lot of work, and the pay isn’t too good. But you get a lot\nof satisfaction out of the results."
