Some AF officers feel that the publicity program will\nbreak down through lethargy at the point of individual contact;\nthat dissemination will never go beyond the internal group.\nPositive direction, they indicate, is not the only thing needed;\nequally important is a functioning agent, responsible for\nproducing and distributing information to the public.\nThe experiment, in any event, is under way and the results\nremain to be seen. Their experience with the internal information\nprogram should merit future study as a case history in the\never-changing field of public relations.\n-30-"
