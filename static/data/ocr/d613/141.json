Hill, Associate Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n111 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harold*\nI am sure you are ,,:beating yourself11 too\nmuch in your letter of October 7 to Jim Miles. It\nwasn*t a very important point but, when I began to\nbe annoyed by the receipt of several communications\nin which no reference was made to time and place,\nlike a good newspaperman I noted the lack. I was\ndelighted to find some small point on which I could\nsend along a suggestion to indicate that I want to\ncontribute something to the NAEB public relations\ncommittee.\nWith all best regards.\ni y yours.\nStewart S. Howe\nSSHjpak\ncc* James S. Miles"
