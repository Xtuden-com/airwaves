Skornia\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nJUL 2 3 1954\n?l?l?|1.0|l,l|12| 1|2|3|4|S|6\ni\nI have just seen your letter of July 19 together with the\ncorrespondence from Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing.\nI think that Anderson's suggestions are excellent and I\nthink a good picture spread of tape network activities\nwould go very well indeed. What is important for you to tell\nAnderson, however, is not to use the term \"your own FM\nradio station\". He ought to use the terml'your owneducational\nradio station\".\nAs I have written to you previously there is a great deal of\ntalk at NBC of converting the entire network to a tape operation.\nHence this kind of material would be of tremendous interest.\nYou might remind Anderson too that the trade press would\nprobably be very much interested including Broadcasting. * Â» $\nI have seen your letter f^rbm John Smith and I am glad that\nhe has taken the civilised point of view.\nTell Rosaline that J/am shipping a couple of copies of\nrecord No. 1 of V|6.ys of Mankind.\nWith all best wishes.\nsns-lg\neymour N.
