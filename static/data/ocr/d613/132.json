There is one change that I thought\nit would be easier to write here than try to change on the ditto — he will spend\nthe January 3-7 period at WDTR, Detroit, rather than at Flint.\nSchooley sent you, as chairman of the Public Relations Policy Committee, a copy of\nhis December 7 letter to Burton. This all grew out of a letter I wrote to Burton\non November 30 as a result of my investigations into the matter of printing the\nNewsletter and my subsequent discussions with you in Chicago. I didn’t bother to\nsend you a copy of that letter because we had talked it all over. However, since,\nfor sane unknown reason, Burton returned the letter I wrote him at the time of his\nreply so I have an extra one and have enclosed it for your information.\nThe publications consultants that Prank mentions are three members of the University’s\nSchool of Journalism and Corannmications faculty who have been studying both the\nJournal and the Newsletter, at Frank’s request, and they are making recommendations.\nThe changes already evident in the Journal are a result of this committee’s recommen¬\ndations, largely.\nWe have just today talked to the printer and are working out a few more of the details\non the printing of the January Newsletter. We are well aware that many of the members\nmay not like the new format, but I really think most of than will. And we’ll probably\nhave to experiment a few months to get just what we want. We’re still working out\nthe mailing angles, including the second class thing that Prank mentioned. All in\nall, it seems to be going pretty good.\nRegards,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHsdfc\nEnclosures"
