If that sounds like too many ’’educates,” believe me it is.\nIt may be unfortunate that it was Dr. Henry who provided the last straw,\nbut I have at last been moved to write a minority opinion which I duly\nsubmit with this letter.\nI herewith demand equal time and/or space for its baptism.\nHugh M.
