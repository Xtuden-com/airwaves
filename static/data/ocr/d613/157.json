The Public Relations Policy Committee is happy that the word \"policy\" has\nbeen added to its title. We believe our function now is to recommend broad\npolicies to the Board together with specific methods for implementing them.\nWe believe it is the responsibility of the Executive Director to be the\nAdministrator in carrying out this policy. The Public Relations Policy ComÂ¬\nmittee as a group and its membership as individuals stand ready to help the\nExecutive Director in the fulfillment of this responsibility. In this regard\nwe believe that the present members of the Public Relations Policy Committee\nshould be continued in office to permit follow-through on these recommendations.\nRespectfully submitted by:\nTHE NAEB PUBLIC RELATIONS POLICY COMMITTEE\nJames Armsey\nWilliam Bender\nLarry Frymire\nStewart S. Howe\nLynn Poole\nElmer Sulzer\nJames S. Miles, Chairman\nCopied NAEB HQ. 10/4/55jy"
