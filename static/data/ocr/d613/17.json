BURROWS, program director\n16 August 195^\nDear Miss Biason:\nI'd like very much to be able to maintain\nmy own file-copy of those \"Newsletters1â€™ using\nmy articles on P/R and Publicity.\nIf it wouldn't cause too much disruption\ndown there, could you arrange to send me same?\nI have the July issue, but have not been able to\nobtain the August. The station receives a single\ncopy which Abbot binds into an inviolable folder.\nIncidentally, I've just mailed to Siegel\nthe copy for September. You should probably\nreceive it within the next few days.\nRegards,"
