Miles\nDirector, WBAA\nPurdue University\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Jim:\nThe NAEB position regarding APBE is that\nwhatever APBE does is ok with us. The primary concern\nof that association is with the teaching of radio and\ntelevision. I don’t see that it conflicts with NAEB.\nLeo Martin holds a similar view. Many APBE members\nare directly or indirectly members of NAEB.\nThe University of Illinois was a charter\nmember of UAPRE - the predecessor of APBE. In fact,\nSchooley attended the originating meetings. The early\nimpetus came from guys like Rus Porter and similar\nIndividuals.\nAPBE is backed pretty much by the industry,\nespecially UARTB which has $5,000 annually in its budget\nto support the organization and its Journal.\nI haven’t seen the APBE Quarterly but here\nagain I don’t see that it would bother us. Leo and I\nhave discussed this and Just didn’t find any conflicts\nof interest.\nTo get down to the matter, I think it depends\non how much teaching of radio-television is done at\nPurdue and whether or not Purdue wishes to be associated\nwith the organized group which has standards of instruction\n(not accrediting) as its primary concern. I honestly\nbelieve that what APBE amounts to only time will tell.\nSincerely,\nFES:frah\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident"
