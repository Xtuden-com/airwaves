I DON’T THINK IT WILL TAKE THIS SORT OF AN INCENTIVE TO CAUSE\nPEOPLE TO SUBMIT PROGRAMsAND ONCE YOU PUT THE DOLLAR SIGN ON THOSE SUB¬\nMITTED, YOU IMMEDIATELY PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE NETWORK ACCEP¬\nTANCE Committee to accept some from the smaller, poorer stations that\nCAN LEAST AFFORD TO PAY THE NETWORK ASSESSMENT FEE. lT*S A VICIOUS\nCIRCLE AND ONE THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WILL SOLVE. I DO GO ALONG\nWITH THE IDEA SUGGESTED UNDER ITEM II, SUB-SECTICNS B AND C. I THINK\nTHESE ARE GOOD IDEAS AND UNDOUBTEDLY SHOULD BE FORMALIZED BY THIS PROCE¬\nDURE. I can read John Dunn’s fine hand in the Item I proposal. I have\nNEVER GONE ALONG WITH DuNN ON THIS. I DON’T THINK WE SHOULD BE SO\nSTRINGENT ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REGULATIONS. THIS IS AN HONEST DIFFERENCE\nOF OPINION AND LIKE I SAID, I JUST OON’T GO ALONG. *\nI GUESS THIS IS ENOUGH FOR THIS TIME. I TRUST THIS FINDS YOU\nALL WELL AND KICKING. ANYTHING TO REPORT YET ON THE CHICAGO MEETING ON\nTHE I4TH?\nDlRECTOR,\nWBAA\nJSMgw"
