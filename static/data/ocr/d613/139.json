It\nhas been my experience in public relations that, while the\npersons closely connected with such events take such matters\nfor granted, it is unwise to assume that the entire memberÂ¬\nship or people in general will remember the date and place\neven though they have seen some previous publicity about it.\nYes?\nWith all best regards.\nSincerely,\nsigned; Stewart S. Howe\nSSH;pak\nEnclosure"
