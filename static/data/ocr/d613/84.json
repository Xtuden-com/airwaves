Hill, Associate Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUni versity of Illinois\nI 19 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harold:\nThanks much for your offer to send us the two\nSETS OF ADDRESSOGRAPH LABELS. WE WILL PAY YOU THE $5.00.\nHowever, it seems to me that this is adding the proverbial\nSTRAW ON THE CAMELâ€™S BACK. AFTER ALL WE ARE USING THESE\nLABELS TO SEND OUT MATERIALS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE OF\nINTEREST AND HELP TO NAEB MEMBERS. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE\nPREPARATION OF THE ADDITIONAL COPIES COSTS US MANY TIMES\nTHIS SERVICE FEE. I KNOW YOUR PROBLEM AND I AM NOT\nPARTICULARLY IRKED AT YOUR REQUEST, I JUST WANTED YOU TO\nSEE THROUGH OUR SIDE OF IT.\nHope it will work out that you and Dorothy can\nGET OVER DURING SEPTEMBER.\nS I NC ERE-LY,\nDirector Radio Station WBAA\nAU6 2L , j\nu i ..
