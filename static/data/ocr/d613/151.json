Skornia\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hal I\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nJanuary 9, 1958\nJAN 11 1958\nI wonder if something couldn't be done to bring\nabout at least a partial standardization of the printed\nprogram schedulejthat NAEB Members send out. I know\nthat their budgets vary tremendously but it doesn't seem\nto me that it is necessary to have so many types of\narrangements of schedules as pass over my desk.\nThis probably wouldn't take the work of any new\ncommittee but might result in a suggested format which\nyou could devise at headquarters that would be flexible\nenough to suit most everyone's pocketbook.\nI am enclosing two typical schedules â€” one for\nthe excellent FM station at Emerson Go liege in Boston\nand the other for the TV station at the University of\nNorth Carolina.\nI know you will agree that both of them could be\neasily improved.\nFranklin Dunham\nChief of Radio-Television"
