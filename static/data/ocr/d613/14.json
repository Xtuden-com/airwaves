October 5“+\n22 Sept. 195^\nPUBLICITY AND PUBLIC RELATIONS\nBy W.B., Jr.\nRecently we came across a special Air Force public\nrelations analysis written in June 195^« It summarizes the\nthinking of a group of top-level service public information\nofficers, and points a changing direction of emphasis for\npublicity and public relations in a large organization.\nSince elements of the report seem to bear on some of the problems\nwhich confront us in NAEB, we will rephrase parts of this report\nas it might have appeared if developed for the Association.\n(We quickly wish to point out that this is no attempt to\nestablish an official viewpoint for NAEB; it is offered\nsimply as ground for constructive thinking on our own goals\nand problems.)\n\"The internal group is considered the first and basic\npublic toward which a public relations program must be directed\nif it is to be successful. The axiom, 1 Public relations, like\ncharity, begins at home,1 is a cardinal principle in the\ninformation field.\"\n(CONT*D)"
