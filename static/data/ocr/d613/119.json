A ®q?; cpf the release was sent to\neach person chosen to attend the Seminar with a note requested that he\nsend it to his local newspaper with a notation that he was attending and\nthat the newspaper might want to use part of the story.\nThanks for forwarding Bill's letter to us and we appreciate the help that\nyou and the Public Relations Policy Committee have been in all publicity\nmatters this year.\nWe're still hoping that the Mies' will be able to come to Champaign for\nthe Fourth of July celebration. Just drop me a card a couple of days in\nadvance and we'll be ready for you.\nCordially,\nHtShcr\nEnc.\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
