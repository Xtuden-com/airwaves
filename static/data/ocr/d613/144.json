It would also have\nprestige value when circulated among administrative\nofficers of present and prospective member-schools*\n\"This is NHK\" is a 24-page brochure sketching\nits physical resources, human resources, program\ntyp©3, and international coverage. It is profusely\nillustrated with photos. The copy is kept to a\nminimum. Size is 5 9» which is distinctive, but\npossibly awkward to mall. The total Impact of the\npiece is that NHK is doing an excellent job in\ncovering Japan life, thought and fine arts.\nMy feeling is that NAEB has much in common with\na state-supported broadcasting operation like NHK*\nAnd, publicity-wise, we could profitably steal a\npage from their book. We have an excellent story\nto tells nation-wide program resources, outstanding\npersonalities who have appeared on NAKB series, our\nbroadcasting, funding and distributing techniques,\netc* If you feel such a brochure is a worthwhile\ngoal for us, I’d like to see us take definite action\nto produce it.\nccs Harry Skomia\nForm 6130 0-55 75rms S"
