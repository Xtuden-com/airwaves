Perhaps you\nand Jim would like: to think about the possibility of a brief digest of\nthe results of this survey (with you drawing implications, if you like)\nfor the Newslettersrather than as a separate item. In addition, I think\nsome of ttie inform, tion used in the Fact Sheets might well be used in\nBender* s proposed column, because we are able to reach a bigger audience\nwith the Newsletter (which goes to all kinds of peoftlajj than we will\nwith the -'â€™ac^' going just to stations. I realise that*s all\nrather confusing, but what t*m trying to say is - let*s think about\nhaving brief resumes of fact Sheets in the ifow&tetter too.\nRegards*\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHSHsJw\nccs James Miles\nEnclosure"
