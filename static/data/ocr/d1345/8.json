In this report, as in these from previous\nyears, attention is directed to the quantitative\naspects of programming—how much of this type\nprogram, or how much change since 1953? We have\nconsistently chosen to avoid such questions as\nthose which deal, for example, with the importance\nof per cent of crime drama.\nSimilarly, the quantitative rather than the quali¬\ntative aspects of trends in programming have been\nemphasized, and emphasis has been given only to\nsuch changes as we have judged to be substantial.\nIn some cases, therefore, a trend that has been\ndiscounted for quantitative reasons may have some\nimportance from the point of view of its content.\nFor example, a one hour weekly program might\nfill a very important need—say, in discussing\npublic issues—but the addition of such a program\nmight be overlooked since it represents a change\nof only a fraction of one per cent of total time.\nFor this reason, the reader more than casually\ninterested in programming trends is invited to\ngive careful attention to Table 1, Appendix B,\nwhich presents comparable programming data for\nthe years 1951 to 1954.\nFigure 2\nNEW YORK TV: TOTAL WEEKLY PROGRAM TIME BY STATIONS, 1951-1954\nMinutes\n0 2500 5000 7500"
