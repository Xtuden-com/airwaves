For such reasons, much of the informa¬\ntion in this report will be unsatisfactory to the\nreader who is interested in actual rather than rela¬\ntive amounts of program time in the various types\nand classes of programs. While it has not been\njudged worthwhile to present both kinds of infor¬\nmation for all analyses, the amount of actual\nprogram time can always be reconstructed with the\naid of Figure 2, Chapter 2, which shows the total\nprogram time for each station.\nStation Differences in Specific Classes of Programs.\nWe now turn to a closer examination of station-\nby-station differences by analyzing each of the\nprogram types in some of its classes and sub-classes.\nIn Figure 23, for example, are presented the pro¬\nportions of total time in drama programs among the\nstations. For all stations, drama constitutes the\nlargest single class of program time. In 1954,\nWATV and WOR-TV both gave nearly 70 per cent\nFigure 24\nNEW YORK TV: PROPORTION OF TOTAL STATION TIME IN CRIME DRAMA"
