The smallest proportion of general informa¬\ntion programming is carried once again by WCBS-\nTV, which has added some program time of this\ntype since 1953, but still has only 3.7 per cent\nof its time accounted for by such programs. The\nsecond smallest proportion, 4.8 per cent, is car¬\nried by WOR-TV, which has been consistently\nreducing the relative amount of information time.\nOnly two classes of orientation programs, public\nissues and religion, will be given attention here.\nFigures 31 and 32 reveal that no station carries\nlarge proportions of either class of program. WABD\nleads in public issues with 3.3 per cent of total\ntime. Other stations carry lesser proportions ranging\ndown to the case of WPIX which, for two succes¬\nsive years, has carried no public issues material\nduring the survey week.\nFigure 29\nNEW YORK TV: PROPORTION OF TOTAL STATION TIME IN\nNEWS PROGRAMS\nPercent\n0 5 10 15 20\n*These figures include the proportion of time in Dave Garroway’s program,\n“TODAY” which accounted for 8.2 percent of WNBT’s time in 1953, and 6.5%\nin 1954."
