Here we\nsee that 77.7 per cent of the weekly total program\ntime was devoted to entertainment-type programs\nin 1954, 17.4 percent was given to information-\ntype programs, and 4.9 per cent was in orientation-\ntype programs. This apportionment of weekly\ntotal program time is almost identical to that\nfound in 1953.\nTable 1, Appendix B, reveals that few major\nchanges have occurred in the programming of the\nvarious classes and sub-classes of programs within\nthe three major types. As a general statement, it\ncan safely be said that New York television pro¬\ngramming has stabilized during 1953 and 1954.\nAmong the entertainment-type programs, we\nfind in Figure 4 that drama again accounts for\nnearly half (46.2 per cent) of the total weekly\nprogram time in 1954; and, once more, the three\nbig sub-classes of drama are comedy (11.1 per\ncent), crime (13.5 percent^), and western drama\n(7.1 percent). Among these three sub-classes of\ndrama, only the proportion of total time in comedy\ndrama has shown a substantial change by gaining\nslightly more than five per cent since 1953. Crime\ndrama is down nearly two per cent, while western\ndrama has remained steady.\nAmong the other sub-classes of drama which\nwhen taken together make up 14.5 per cent of\ntotal weekly program time, there is evidence that\nthe kinds of drama known as “soap operas” con¬\nstitute a smaller proportion of total program time\nin 1954 than in 1953. For example, non-serial\nfamily relations drama occupies only 0.8 per cent\nin 1954 as compared with 3.1 per cent in 1953\nand 4.0 per cent in 1952; serial domestic drama\nFigure 3\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL PROGRAM TIME ON NEW YORK\nTELEVISION, JANUARY, 1954\nAll Other\nInformation\nNews 6.1% 11.3%"
