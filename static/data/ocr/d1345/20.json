Table 7 in Appendix B shows the dis¬\ntribution of program time in each time segment\namong programs for the different audiences.\nThe Distribution of Program Types among the Time\nSegments.\nIn the previous section, we have examined some\ndifferences in programming among the time seg¬\nments, and have discussed principally entertain¬\nment type programs. Now we shall analyze each\nof the major types of programs in terms of their\ndistribution across the time segments of the broad¬\ncasting day. In interpreting these findings the\nreader should bear in mind that the time segments\nare not of equal length; therefore, the proportion\nof all program time in a particular time segment\nshould be considered when noting the proportion\nof any given program type contained in that seg¬\nment.\nFigure 14 reveals that about 30 per cent of\nall entertainment time is found in each of the\ntime segments of domestic, children’s and adult\nhours, and the remaining 10 per cent falls in the\nlate hours. The proportion of entertainment time\nin the domestic and in the late hours has remained\nabout the same since 1951. The adult hours have\nsteadily been losing their share of all entertain^\nment time, and now contain about nine per cent\nless than they did in 1951. By contrast, the\nchildren's hours have picked up 5.6 per cent of\nentertainment program time since 1951.\nFigure 14\nNEW YORK TV: THE PROPORTION OF TOTAL WEEKLY LATE HOUR\nPROGRAM TIME DEVOTED TO SELECTED CLASSES OF ENTERTAINMENT\nPercent\n100"
