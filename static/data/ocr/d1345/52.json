It does seem\nlikely, however, that primary advertising has made\na real increase of about 16 hours, or about two\nper cent of total time, since 1953.\nAdvertising Across the Broadcast Day.\nFigure 44 shows that the domestic hours, with\n2017.3 minutes of primary advertising, contain the\nlargest amount of such material, while the late\nhours have the least with only 541.2 minutes of\nprimary advertising for the week. Since not all\ntime segments contain the same amount of pro¬\ngram time, Figure 45 is interesting in that it\nshows the relative amount of primary advertising\nin each time period. In 1954, the domestic hours\nhave the largest proportion of program time de¬\nvoted to primary advertising with 16 per cent.\nThe other three time periods are four per cent\nless. Apparently the daytime hours of weekdays\nare more heavily saturated with primary advertising\nthan other times. Table 26, Appendix B, reveals\nthat the same is true of secondary advertising;\nFigure 46\nNEW YORK TV: TOTAL ADVERTISING TIME, BY STATIONS\nMinutes"
