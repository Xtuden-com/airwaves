The propor¬\ntions of time in live entertainment programs range\nfrom 13.9 per cent for WATV to 75.2 per cent for\nWNBT, as shown in Table 22. For a specific\nclass of entertainment, drama. Table 22 shows that\nsome stations have little live drama programming\n(WATV and WPIX have none at all), while one\nstation, WNBT, has as much as 40 per cent of its\ndrama programs in live form.\nThe proportion of information type programs in\nlive form is shown to be high for all stations by\nTable 24, ranging from 63.9 per cent for WPIX\nto 100 per cent for WOR-TV. Orientation pro¬\ngrams, on the other hand, more frequently are\nfound in recorded form, as shown by Table 25.\nThree of the seven stations have less than half\nof their orientation programs in live form, with\nWOR-TV having least of all with 29.1 per cent.\nHowever, one station, WABD, did have all of its\norientation programming reported as live by the\nmonitors in 1954.\nFIGURE 32\nNEW YORK TV: PROPORTION OF TOTAL STATION\nTIME IN RELIGION PROGRAMS\nPercent\n5\n10\nWCBS-TV\nWNBT\nWABC-TV\n(formerly, WJZ-TV)\nWPIX\nWATV\nWOR-TV\nWABD\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n0.6\n0.0\n0.9\n1.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.7\n4.2\n2.8\n2.1\n0.8\n3.2\n0.3\n1.5\n1.7\n0.7\n0.0\n1.2\n2.9\n2.1\n0.0\n0.0\n0.5\n2.6\n1.9\n2.3\n3.6\n1.9"
