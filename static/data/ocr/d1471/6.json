  "text": "NOTE REGARDING PERCENTAGES AND AVERAGES:\nFor all Tables attention is called to the inevitability of\nvariance in averages by the various classifications, one from\nanother. For example although it would appear that the averages\nin all five groups for each table should be the same, the fact\nthat the relative size of the various sub-classifications differ\nwidely (only one city was surveyed in Canada, for a very small\nsample, yet in the average for \"By States\" it would serve as 1/3\nof the computation) reveals how different desirable or undesirable\nresults could be obtained by using the method which best serves\none's purposes. This is a sobering thought in evaluating the\nimportance to attach to such a survey for proving audience\nresponse, particularly:in view of the extremely small number of\nlisteners sometimes found at any one of the 150 or so periods\nper week generally reported on national surveys.\nIn general the averages found in the \"Phone versus Personal\nInterview\" and \"Occupat ons\" Tables are more nearly the average\nthat would be secured by individuals than that of any other\nclassification, since the subdivisions within these two groups\nare of more nearly equal size than those of the other categories."
