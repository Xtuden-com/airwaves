Such conclusions should be avoided. Although it is interesting\nto note an apparently more critical reaction to commercials in cities of\n50,000 or over than in smaller cities and towns/ Indiana listeners seem\nto find more commercials enjoyable than non-Indiana U,S, listeners, while\nCanadian listeners, if our small sample is adequate to indicate even a trend,\nseem to find less enjoyable commercials, than U.S. listeners.\nThis Table, like all the others, raises the question of the greater\nsuggestibility of personal interviews as compared to telephone surveys.\nIt also suggests that no-station and one-station towns, in which a larger\nproportion of listening is probably to clear and strong regional channel\nstations, hear more good commercials than those with more stations in town,\nin which case more local stations would seem to be involved. The effect\nof increasing competition, and different kinds of competition, would also\nbe interesting to study in this connection."
