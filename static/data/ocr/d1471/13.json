Should:It have been \"news more often\" \"news more regularly\" or\nany of a dozen other wordings rather than \"more news?\" ; If so how can\nthe interviewer be kept from suggesting the answer he is conditioned to\nexpect? News by radio, it appears in the untabulated notes accompany¬\ning their replies, reaches listeners by many programs other than traditi¬\nonal newscasts. Commercials, forums, and disc-jockey programs all had\nrespondents who found them to have news value or one type or another.\nNote the one-station and two-station city positions.\nThis survey, like most others which attempt to record answers to\nquest ions which it is difficult to define without suggesting a reply,\nprobably proves only an appreciation of news by radio. How can the sum\nof many \"guesses\" or opinions (ask yourself this question) be made into\npositive evidence or proof in this or any other survey?"
