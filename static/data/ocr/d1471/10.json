Although certain Indiana areas with FM\nstations were found to have as high as 60% ownership, some; Indiana areas\nwith FM stations a year or more old had below 20%, FM stations* in low-\nownership FM areas would seem to be leaving something to be desired,\nirrespective of the merits of FM or AM,1 if they arouse no more curiosity\nthan this about FM, In general, FM ownership-seems lower in Indiana\nthan in any of the areas surveyed except Canada, where little FM recep¬\ntion is available. Rural FM ownership, as might be expected in this\nphase,;is lowest* Only two FM stations in all were located in the 3-\nstation cities 1isted."
