Procedures:\nDue to its smaller dimensions,, the Indianapolis survey is not, perhaps,\nas statistically valid as the Bloomington survey; nevertheless, we feel\nthat it indicates many important trends in metropolitan radio listening,\nIndianapolis contains four 5,000 watt AM stations, each affiliated with\none of the major networks: WIRE - NBC; WISH - ABC; WFBM - CBS; WIBC -\nMBS; and one FM station, WABW, on interim operation,\n512 calls were completed in Indianapolis and outlying suburbs at the\ntimes indicated in Table VIL The survey procedure was similar to that\nof the Bloomington survey. However, only those questions to which\nsufficient replies to be significant were made, have been tabulated,\nB.
