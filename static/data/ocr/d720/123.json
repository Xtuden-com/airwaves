Each announcer\nprogrammed his own music, and\nannounced it. No one person was\nin charge of these operations. The\nselection of music was somewhat\nhaphazard, as were the remarks\nsaid about the music, and, at times,\nthe pronunciation of composers’\nnames.

Next, using\nthe records we had available, we\nbegan some advance programming\nof music, trying to present balanced\nprograms of good recordings.

We were even¬\ntually able to expand the number of\nmusic programs, and give our list¬\neners a far wider variety of good\nmusic. We also expanded our fa¬\ncilities for broadcasting live con¬\ncerts, from the various recital halls\nand auditoriums on the campus.\nMany schools begin broadcasting\non the proverbial shoe-string.
