There is also a brief\ntreatment of light, basic optics and\nlenses. The features and specifica¬\ntions of the Kay Lab system are also\nincluded.\nThe final chapter gives details for\nconstructing an experimental closed\ncircuit camera employing the 5527\niconoscope camera tube. The author\nstates that this camera may be built\nat a cost of a few hundred dollars\nincluding the camera tube which\ncosts $150. The camera, video am¬\nplifier, and modulator-oscillator\nare built in a 15x7x3 inch chassis\nwhich is mounted above a similar\nchassis containing the pulse and\npower generator, making the com¬\nplete unit 15x7x12. A standard\ntelevision receiver is used as a mon¬\nitor.\nFor its size the book contains a\ngreat deal of technical informa¬\ntion. It should prove worth while\nas a reference book, as well as\nproviding much useful information\nfor technicians serving the equip¬\nment. — CECIL S. BIDLACK,\nNAEB TV Engineer.\nQuotations From -\nTELEVISION IN THE MAKING, edited by Paul\n- Rotha, Hastings House, New York, 1956.\n“Video-tape, they say, can be\nplayed back almost immediately . . .\nOnce again it is in the service of\nspeed and intimacy, slashing the\ntime for thought and skill . . . Per¬\nhaps television will, by cutting out\nthe middle-man, by piping its pro¬\nduct direct to the viewer, find more\nopportunity for the creative artist\nwho has been so frustrated in the\ncinema ? Perhaps we may see ahead\nthe day when, by providing the\nlowest possible kind of entertain¬\nment, television will allow the film\nto grow to adulthood?” (Introduc¬\ntion, page 20)\nFrom the Chapter “Television\nfor Children” by Michael Westmore\nFEBRUARY 1937\n27"
