Therefore, it was ne¬\ncessary to take an overall percentage\nof the week-day viewing for Mon¬\nday through Friday and then set\nup a time pattern which was a com¬\nposite for the Monday through\nFriday period- Saturday and Sun¬\nday were set up in a similiar man¬\nner.\nThese time patterns showed in\ntotal percentages the number of\nhours spent televiewing and the\ntime at which televiewing began and\nended. The patterns revealed the\npercentage of boys and girls tele¬\nviewing at the various hours of the\nday and evening, and showed the\nheaviest and lightest periods of\nviewing. They indicated the pro¬\ngrams that were available during\nthe many periods of the day and\nevening. These televiewing time\npatterns were visual proof that\nboys and girls had well-defined ha¬\nbits of viewing.\n• CONCLUSIONS drawn from\nthe evidence obtained through the\nstudy follow:\n1. Contrary to the beliefs of\nmany, children did not spend count¬\nless hours televiewing. In the first\nsix grades, 91 per cent of the boys\naveraged a few minutes over 18\nhours per seven-day week, 3 per\ncent averaged 23 hours per week, 4\nper cent averaged 25 hours per\nweek, and 1 per cent averaged 29\nhours per week. Thirty-four\nhours was the greatest number\nspent in televewing by any one boy\nin these grades. This boy was a\npupil in the fourth grade.\nEighty-nine per cent of the girls\nin these grades averaged 19 hours\nper seven-day week, 5 per cent\naveraged 21 hours per week, 3 per\ncent averaged 23 hours per week,\n2 per cent averaged 26 hours, and\n1 per cent averaged 28 hours per\nweek. The highest number of\nhours recorded was 55 spent in\nteleviewing by a girl in the third\ngrade. This number was obviously\nan extreme when compared to the\naverage of 19 spent by the majority\nof girls.\nThese results show that teleview¬\ning time spent by children in the\nfirst six grades was only 11 per\ncent of the 168 hours available in a\nseven-day week for the various\nactivities of eating, sleeping, tele¬\nviewing, reading, attending school,\ngoing to the movies, and so forth.\n2. Long periods of televiewing\nwere not indulged in by these child-\nVariety attracts\nas well as pleasure.\nren. The hours spent televiewing\nwere broken into time periods vary¬\ning from 15 minutes to one hour at\nthe most in any one given period.\n3. After having had television\nreceivers for six months or longer,\nchildren followed well-defined pat¬\nterns of televiewing which they ad¬\nhered to very closely throughout the\nweek. Graphs of the televiewing\ntime patterns were constructed and\nthe contour of these patterns was\ndetermined by the popularity of the\n26\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
