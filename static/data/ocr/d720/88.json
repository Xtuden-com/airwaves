WSPD-TV in\nToledo made available one-half\nhour each weekday morning for\nwhat is known as T .U.-Tele study,\nits purpose being the offering of\nregular college courses on either a\ncredit or non-credit basis. The\nUniversity has had no studio of its\nown and no equipment to make\nKinescope recordings. Hence, pro¬\ngrams have had to be live broad¬\ncasts from the local studio. That\nexperience gained by the Univer¬\nsity of Toledo during the past\nyears may be of maximum value to\nother college administrators and fa¬\nculty, answers to the following\nquestions are presented:\nWhat courses can be expected to\nattract and hold the interest of a\nTV audience ? Does teaching on\ntelevision differ from regular class¬\nroom teaching ? Can courses be\npresented via television and still\nmaintain academic standards ?\nWhat allowances on teaching loads\nare fair to those teaching by tele¬\nvision ? What special teaching aids\nare needed? How should the re¬\nsponsibility for the administration\nof courses be handled? What are\nthe calculated risks ? What are the\nbenefits ? Does experience on com¬\nmercial channels throw any light on\nthe role of TV in the future of\nhigher education?\n• IN SELECTING courses to be\noffered by television for an off-\ncampus audience it is necessary to\ntake into account the type of\naudience to be reached at the time\ncourses are to be broadcast, the\namount of time allotted for the tele¬\nvising of the course or courses, and\nthe extent to which laboratory and\nspecial apparatus may be essential.\nIn addition, the possible effective¬\nness of the various faculty members\nin teaching via TV has a great in¬\nfluence on the course selections.\nA careful consideration must be\ngiven to faculty available to teach\nin the subject matter areas which\nmeet the limitations imposed by\nother factors previously mentioned.\nConsequently, the subject matter\narea taught by the teacher available\nand willing to teach may have a\ngreat influence on the courses to\nbe taught.\nT.U.’s allotments of time thus\nfar have defined the audience as\none consisting largely of house¬\nwives, older people, and “home-\nbound” persons who could observe\nmid-morning or mid-afternoon tele¬\nvision programs. The distance from\nthe campus of the commercial\nstudio dictated that any courses in¬\nvolving heavy or difficult-to-trans-\nport apparatus should be avoided.\nThe length of the broadcast time\n(five periods of one-half hour\neach) dictated that a special adapta¬\ntion of semester courses or specially\nprepared courses would have to be\noffered. It was clear, too, that\nspecial scripts would have to be\ndeveloped to make their presenta¬\ntion effective. The following\ncourses were developed and pre¬\nsented: Those offering two credit\n14\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
