Each unit has a separate\ncontrol center so that each may orig¬\ninate “lessons” exclusively within\nits own group or, in addition, may\nbe cross-connected to enable any\ngroup to receive lessons from either\nor both of the other two units. Unit\nA, used for English-speech, includes\nan originating classroom, three re¬\nceiving rooms, a control room, and\na small auditorium which may orig¬\ninate or receive programs or lessons.\nUnit B, used for typing, includes\na control room, an ■ originating\nclassroom, and a receiving room.\nBy WANDA B.
