We want\nthe information on the back of the\njackets, but we don’t have filing\nspace for the whole thing. At\nWUOM, we’ve devised a method of\nsoaking off the back page of the\njacket, the page with the informa¬\ntion on it, drying this page, and\nfiling it in our large folders on each\ncomposer. If we’d filed all the\nioriginal jackets we would have\nbeen forced out of the music library\nlong ago for lack of space. As it\n■is now, our sheets occupy one)\nbusiness-size metal file cabinet.\nAfter you’ve established opera¬\ntion, you need continuous ideas for\nputting selections together. For in¬\nstance, you might on occasion want\nto have an all-Mozart program, or\nan all twentieth century program,\nor an all-American program. These\nare just gimmicks to hang programs\non—but they’re nice gimmicks. Or\nyou might want an all-Heifetz pro¬\ngram, or a program of only “recent\nreleases.” Often, these gimmick-\ntype programs are more fun to do\nand more fun to listen to than a\nprogram with no central idea. Oc¬\ncasionally we’ve had programs of\nonly ballet music, or only folk mu¬\nsic, or only flute music. It’s some¬\ntimes fun to let your imagination\ngo. Right now I’m working on a\nrather extensive series of programs\non Swedish music. A few months\nago, we had a series on Japanese\nmusic. I might add, parenthetically,\nthat we carry music programs pro¬\nduced by the British Broadcasting\nCorporation, the French Broadcast¬\ning System, Radio Italiana, Radio\nNederland, and the Association of\nGerman Broadcasters.\nIn closing, I’d like to return to\nthe thought with which I began:\nthat it’s up to us, as educational\nbroadcasters, to maintain and when¬\never possible, to raise the standards\nof our programs. In general, ra¬\ndio programs on the commercial net¬\nworks have deteriorated steadily.\nWriting about this in the New York\nHerald Tribune, John Crosby has\nsaid: “I feel that it is immoral to\nput shoddy programs on the air\ndeliberately. The striving down¬\nward in radio has reached into pro¬\ngrams in insidious ways. There is\nthe comedian who throws out a\njoke because he feels it a little too\nelevated for his audience, the quiz¬\nzes which degenerated from “In¬\nformation, Please,” to a level of\nidiocy, the selection of dramas of\nthe lowest common denominator.\nThis imperceptible cheapening of\nprograms did not go unnoticed by\nthe listeners. The average listener\nmay not be a coherent critic in the\nsense that he can put his finger ex¬\nactly on what is wrong, but he is\na very good critic in the sense he\nknows something is wrong. He may\nnot be driven away from the pro¬\ngram, but the intensity of his satis¬\nfaction in it is sharply reduced.”\nI’d suggest that all of us make\nan earnest effort to present radio\nprograms that are going to bring a\nreal, and, if possible, a lasting sat¬\nisfaction to our listeners.\n26\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
