  "text": "What Do They Learn?\nContinued from page 6\ngreat books; the sciences of astron¬\nomy, anthropology, paleontology,\nchemistry, physics; great events in\nhistory; ethics, logic; psychology;\nphilosophy, and religion; music as\nan art; the graphic arts. They con¬\nstantly look for talent to do these\nprograms. A central programming\nagency, with $12 million endow¬\nments set up by the Ford Founda¬\ntion, records these programs on film\nand distributes them.\nThe worth of these stations is\nnow over $10 million. They often\ncost 3, 4, or 5 hundred thousand\ndollars a year, each, to maintain.\nThey are giving courses for credit\nunder university auspices to those\nwho cannot conveniently go to col¬\nlege—a High School of the Air in\nPittsburgh, already has 4,000 drop¬\nouts back in school by television.\nThey have graduated their first two\nclasses in examinations exactly like\nthose of day-students. Surgical\nand medical schools are doing away\nwith operating theatres for students.\nThey look at the operation from a\nfront-row television screen, as do\nmen and women in many other uni¬\nverity laboratories in physics, che¬\nmistry, and the natural sciences.\nIn many cities, television has\nbeen harnessed to learning in the\ngrade schools, the high schools, the\njunior colleges, and the universities\nas either a direct teaching aid or a\nmeans of illustration for established\ncurriculum practice. The research\nis going valiantly on, not to displace\nteachers nor to particularly cut edu¬\ncational costs, but io raise the quali¬\nty or teaching and to accelerate\nlearning.\n• WE ARE IN a world struggle\nof opposing ideologies. Man can¬\nnot remain either slave or half-free.\nAll the initiative our children pos¬\nsess all the ingenuity and inventive¬\nness of our young people, must be\nmobilized to keep our blessed coun¬\ntry secure.\nLong ago, I became convinced\nthat the only final answer to the\nproblems of the mass, of the com¬\nmunity, of the individual, was edu¬\ncation. From then on, I know\nwhat to do. I choose the new\nmedia of communication for my\nfield of work. Now, I see children\npassing courses with higher grades\nbecause of tested audio and visual\nillustrations. I see people, who had\nlost interest in learning, come back\nagain to participate in its everlast¬\ning gifts. I see all our work in\neducational motion pictures find a\nuniversal market through television,\nour work in radio take on the ad¬\nvantage of the sense of sight,\nI see our people entertained\nhugely by these new media. I see\nentertainment carry an educational\ningredient, consciously or uncon¬\nsciously — I’m not concerned. I see\nour children learning out of school,\nas well as within school.\nIt is up to you and me to give\nour support to that which has per¬\nmanent value, good motivation, and\nspiritual grace. We can endow our\nchildren with no better lasting gift!\n30\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
