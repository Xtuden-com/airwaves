A cooperative\nnewsdealer in Lansing, Michigan\nmade it possible for me to sell\nTV Guide at cut rates to my stu¬\ndents. This was a bargain for both\nme and them. They liked the sav¬\nings; I was happy to see them be¬\ncome selective in their televiewing.\nThey surprise you with their ability\nto distinguish the first-rate from the\nphoney. As long as TV has its\npeaks of achievement, there is little\ncause to panic about the many\ndreary valleys in between. For if\nwe can get our students excited\nabout climbing those peaks, pro¬\nducers may be surprised in a gen¬\neration at how empty the many val¬\nleys have become.\nTaped TV\nContinued from page 21\n$45,000 each, and estimates have\nbeen made that cost might be re¬\nduced to as little as $25,000 within\nseveral years. Videotape Recorders\nwill be available in the console\nmodel, weighing 1100 pounds, or in\na rack mounting adaptation, weigh¬\ning 1250 pounds.\nAs soon as the price is reduced\ndue to increased production and\nsales, educational institutions will\nfind the Videotape Recorder the\nreal answer to the bottleneck of in¬\nschool televiewing. Live programs\ncan be taped and distributed via\nclosed-circuit systems at times com¬\npatible with the class schedules.\nTelecourses can be handled in the\nsame way, and scores of additional\napplications will suggest themselves\nin all fields of instruction.\nConsistency\nContinued from page 9\nsubject matter areas not presently\nserved by programs.\n4) They should become familiar\nwith current programs of all types\nso as to be better informed as to\nprogram availabilities with the end\nin view of preparing their students\nto be more discriminating listeners\nand viewers.\n5) They should encourage in¬\ndividual parents and groups inter¬\nested in child development to use\nevery legitimate means which will\nresult in better commercial radio\nand television programs.\nThe writer knows that many\nteachers have already accepted their\nobligations with respect to radio and\ntelevision. May the number of\nsuch dedicated teachers grow until\nit includes the entire profession!—\nTRACY F. TYLER, Editor.\n30\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
