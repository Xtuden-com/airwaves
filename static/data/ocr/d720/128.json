Sar-\nnoff that NBC in 1957 will pro¬\nvide the first live programming\never to be produced expressly for\neducational television stations on a\nnational basis.\n“It is NBC’s plan, during 1957,”\nMr. Sarnoff said, “to furnish spe¬\ncialized educational programs to all\nof the nation’s non-commercial ed¬\nucational stations. These programs\nwill be produced in our studios and\nfurnished live to the educational\nstations over our network lines.”\nThe NBC President said the pro¬\ngramming service will be provid¬\ned at no charge to educational sta¬\ntions. NBC has committed more\nthan $300,000 for programs, pro¬\nduction facilities and personnel in\nconnection with the 1957 project.\nHe also announced that the Edu¬\ncational Television and Radio Cen¬\nter at Ann Arbor, Michigan, which\nhas received funds from the Ford\nFoundation, is supplying the local\nloops to connect the educational\nstations with NBC network lines\nand is consulting closely with NBC\non the design of the programs.\n“These programs will be tele¬\ncast during an afternoon time pe¬\nriod which does not conflict with\nour regular schedule,” he declared.\n“They will also be kinescoped for\nrepeat broadcast or subsequent\nclassroom use, thus creating an im¬\nportant and enduring educational\ntelevision library.”\n• MR. SARNOFF said that the\neducational programs to be provid¬\ned by NBC next year will consist of\nthree half-hour presentations each\nweek with instruction in mathemat¬\nics, the humanities and government.\nThe project will extend through 26\nweeks in 1957, beginning in March\nfor 13 weeks, and resuming in Oc¬\ntober for another 13-week period.\nEach of the three program series\nwill be conducted by experts in the\nfield; James R. Newman, author\nand editor of “The World of Math¬\nematics,” already has agreed to su¬\npervise the mathematics course.\n“We see our 26-week project as\na demonstration operation,” Mr.\nSarnoff said. “We believe that\nwhen our project terminates at the\nend of 1957, its values and lessons\ncan be carried forward in ways that\nwill help enrich the whole future of\neducation by television.”\n22\n/The AERT JOURNAL"
