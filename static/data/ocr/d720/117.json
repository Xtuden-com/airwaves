  "text": "AT COMMERCIAL TV\nWhy have attitudes changed?\nlow the story in the “foreign lan¬\nguage” of Elizabethan English; to\nexpect them to derive pleasure\nfrom the subtleties of character\nand motive is impossibly remote—\nuntil they can see the play. I shall\nnever forget the difference that\nMaurice Evans and “The Hallmark\nHall of Fame” made in my teaching\nof Macbeth to high school seniors\nThe year before the telecast I had\nto spend considerable time trying\nto indicate simply what happened;\nthe Evans production enabled me\nto proceed at once to a discussion\nof the play as a work of art.\nTV drama in general has an\nenormous potential for teaching\nliterature. For everybody can now\nbe a first-nighter. TV has destroy¬\ned the dramatic hinterland. Main\nStreet, actually Side-Street, USA.,\nhas become the Great White Way.\nSensing this trend, Scholastic Mag¬\nazine began two years ago to print\na weekly schedule of TV programs\nwith educational value. Last year,\nScholastic Teacher, a teachers’ pro¬\nfessional magazine, started a series\nof “Teleguides,” which give a\nteacher enough information about\na drama or a documentary to en¬\nable him to assign it for class\ncredit. “Cyrano,” “The Devil’s\nDisciple,” “The Corn is Green,”\nand “The Taming of the Shrew”\nwere among the choices.\n• LAST MARCH, The English\nJournal, NCTE magazine for high-\nschool teachers, revealed its aware¬\nness of the potential of commercial\nTV by printing a study guide for\nOlivier’s Richard III, prepared by\nFrank and Audrey Hodgins of the\nEnglish Department at the Uni¬\nversity of Maryland. Teacher re¬\nsponse to this was so good that the\nj Journal has started a regular\nmonthly feature, “The Public Arts,”\nidesigned to help English teachers\nmake the most of the mass media\nwhenever their content is relevant.\nA study-guide for Shaw’s Man\nand Superman (Hallmark, Nov¬\nember 25) appeared in a November\nissue. Plans are under way for a\n“Shaw Festival” to be held in the\nnation’s literature classrooms the\nweek before the telecast. This\nwould be a kind of “educational\nspectacular” dramatizing the im-\nFEBRUARY 1957\n11"
