It cer¬\ntainly can’t do anything but elevate\ntheir tastes, if they give it a chance.\nAnd this brings us back to G. B.\nShaw—that the thing weve got to\ndo is give people the chance to listen\nto good music. This, of course, radio\nis eminently suited to do.\n• ON SOME OCCASIONS\nwhen I’ve been invited to talk on\nmusic programming, the host has\nsuggested, with varying degrees of\nsubtlety, that “You don’t have to be\nhighbrow.” My usual response is\n“That’s all I can be; I can’t be any¬\nthing else.”\nYou see, our broadcasting at the\nUniversity of Michigan is on a\nrather high cultural level. We feel\nthat, as an educational station, we\nmust give people the best—the best\nin dramas, in talk programs, in mu¬\nsic, in newscasting, and so on—in¬\nsofar as we are able to. We enter¬\ntain a theory that by exposing peo¬\nple to the best, we can perhaps raise\ntheir tastes and their understand¬\nings and thereby educate them.\nWe still do a lot of thinking\nabout what we should put on the\nair. We wonder whether we are giv¬\ning people what they want, and then,\nof course, we wonder whether what\nthey want is what they ought to\nhave. We feel we have a responsi¬\nbility to stretch people’s ability to\nunderstand and to accept new ideas\nand to develop their tastes. We\ntherefore do not program down to\npeople, but rather, we program up\nto them. There is no condescen¬\nsion on our part (at least not con¬\nsciously). We expect a lot from\nour listeners, and they seem to re¬\nspond favorably.\nYou will, therefore, hear no give¬\naway quiz programs on our stations,\nno rock-and-roll, no soap operas.\nWe have very little so-called “popu¬\nlar music,” and of course we have\nno commercials. About 69 per cent\nof our broadcast day is devoted to\ngood music.\nAll of these music programs are\ncreated in terms of leading people\nrather than in terms of following\nthem.\nBefore I come to setting up good\nmusic programs, I’d like to tell you\nwhat we know of audience reaction\nto this concept. We canvassed re¬\ncently 5,000 listeners on our mailing\nlist. About 30 per cent (incidentally,\nthat’s really a phenomenal response)\nresponded. Most (a total of 683 of\nthose who responded) wanted clas¬\nsical and light classical music. The\nnext category, in order of prefer¬\nence, was drama, and that had 129\nAll our music programs\nare created in terms of\nleading people rather than\nof following them.\nvotes. This showed us that we have\nbuilt a receptive audience for good\nmusic. At least one listener wrote\nat the bottom of his questionnaire:\nFEBRUARY 1957\n15"
