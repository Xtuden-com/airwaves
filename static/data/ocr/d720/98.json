The unique¬\nness of the telecourse enabled her\nto bring in special persons from the\ncommunity as resource personnel\nand arrange some special demon¬\nstrations. With a kinescope these\nfeatures could be introduced at the\nappropriate time for future classes.\nThe University of Toledo has\nprofited also from the public rela¬\ntions standpoint. It has been\nbrought closer to the public it\nserves. Students have applied for\nadmission because of their families’\npraise of T.U. instructors. Ideas\nfor new courses via TV have re¬\nsulted from suggestions of TV\nviewers.\nThe individual gets great per¬\nsonal satisfaction from doing a good\neducational job for a large au¬\ndience. Faculty members find that\nthey must be prepared to meet pub¬\nlic acclaim and that they will be\nrecognized publicly and perhaps\ncalled by name by persons unknown\nto them heretofore. In fact, this\nis perhaps a kind of recognition\n24\nmany faculty members had not\ndreamed of as being compatible\nwith their chosen field of activity.\nIt is seldom that a professor of\npoetry or child development expects\nwidespread public acclaim. Fa¬\nculty members teaching TV courses\nmust expect to receive a quantity\nof mail seeking information and\nasking questions, and of course\nmany requests to appear as speakers\nbefore groups. The “ivory tower”\nseclusion may give way to general\npublic recognition.\n• PREDICTIONS have been\nmade that television will revolution¬\nize college teaching methods and\nthereby lessen considerably the need\nfor extra faculty, classrooms, la¬\nboratories, and so forth, as enroll¬\nments expand during the next two\ndecades. T.U.’s experience thus\nfar does ont support this.\nTelevision teaching will result in\nimproved teaching techniques. In\nitself it is primarily a valuable addi¬\ntional video-audio teaching aid. It\ncan be used to present certain types\nof subject matter and relieve the\ninstructor of the necessity of repeti¬\ntion. Some classroom and labora¬\ntory demonstrations can be given\nmore advantageously by television\nthan from the lecture platform, as\nin the case of certain science de¬\nmonstrations. The television pre¬\nsentation which can be recorded on\nfilm can be expertly done and view¬\ned as clearly by a student in the\nback of the room as the one in the\nfront row. Perhaps lectures by\nthe great teachers can be purchased\nfor use and re-use. On a single\ncampus, TV could become a med-\nThe XERT JOURNAL"
