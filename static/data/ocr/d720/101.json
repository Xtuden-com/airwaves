The age of the boy\nand girl played an important part in\ndetermining the time of day and\nevening when their televiewing be¬\ngan and ended. Parents were very\ndefinite in recording in the diaries\nthe exact time when their child was\nsent off to bed and viewing stopped.\n4. Children in the first six\ngrades had very definite program\npreferences. They emphasized\nchildren’s programs, comedy-dra¬\nmas, variety programs, and wes¬\nterns. There were 22 hours of wes¬\ntern movies being telecast during\nthe week in which the diaries were\nkept. Children spent about 20 per\ncent of their televiewing time\nwatching these western programs.\nChildren seem to have well-balanced\ndiets in their televiewing program\npreferences.\n5. The majority of this group\nin the first six grades observed a\nregular mealtime schedule and a\nregular bedtime schedule which was\nanywhere from 7:30 to 8:15 p.m.\non week days. On Friday and Sa¬\nturday evenings they were permit¬\nted to teleview for an hour or more\nlater than usual.\n6. Televiewing did not begin for\nthis group until 5 :00 p.m. on week\ndays, which was one and a half\nhours after school had closed.\nTherefore, we might assume that\nchildren were doing many things\nthey liked to do between 3:30 and\n5:30 p.m., other than watching TV.\n7. Upper grade elementary chil¬\ndren expressed a desire to see more\ninteresting and exciting programs\non science, history, art, and music;\nhowever, they must be in some dra¬\nmatic form and well presented.\n8. It was found that seventh-\nand eighth-grade boys and girls\ndiffered considerably from those in\nthe lower grades. They televiewed\nlonger, as indicated by 96 per cent\nwho averaged 25 hours per week,\n3 per cent averaged 27 hours, and\n1 per cent averaged 29 hours.\nNinety-three per cent of the girls\nBreadth of under¬\nstanding is sought.\naveraged 23 hours per week, 5 per\ncent averaged 26 hours, and 2 per\ncent averaged 31 hours. This group\ndid not observe a regular mealtime\nschedule; apparently the mealtime\nschedule was governed by the pro¬\ngrams the children liked. This\nschedule varied from day to day\nbecause of the great diversity in\nprogram preferences. A regular\nbedtime hour was observed between\n8:30 and 9:30 p.m. during week\ndays; however, Friday and Satur¬\nday televiewing continued until\n11:00 p.m. and occasionally until\nmidnight. Seventh and eighth\ngraders preferred talent shows,\ncomedy-variety, mystery, children’s\nstories, drama, and westerns.\n9. Boys and girls in the ninth\nthrough the twelfth grades did not\nbegin televiewing until right after\ndinner when they began with the\nnews and sports and then divided\ntheir time according to their prefer¬\nence until approximately 10:00 p.m.\nThe majority of this group averaged\nNOVEMBER 1956\n27"
