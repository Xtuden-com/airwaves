The sentiment concern¬\ning a broken heart and the lover’s good¬\nbye seems to be the principal theme. It\nis done in good style and should attract\nyour fancy. A good start.\n\"BANKING ON THE\nWEATHER”\nWritten by Joe Young-Sammy Fein\nPublished by Witmark\nThe \"banking in love” idea expressed\nthusly in words and music: moonlight,\nstars, and of course banking on the one\ngirl. A tune probably not of hit possi¬\nbilities, but not bad at all. Good for\ndancing.\n\"MAN TO MAN”*\nWritten by Chiappo-Ibanez-Fields\nPublished by Bosworth\nThe American version of the stirring\nItalian success \"Lo Studente Passa.” A\ncatchy tune with an alluring rhythm.\nRecommended as a good punch fitting\nin any type of program. Especially in¬\nteresting and useful as a male quartet, as\nevidenced by its similar use in Keith Mc-\nCleod’s \"Regimentalists” chorus. Fast\nstepping.\n\"THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF\nDEVIL IN YOUR ANGEL\nEYES”*\nWritten by Little Jack Little-Fred Coots\nPublished by Keit-Engel\nA devilishly good song! It will no\ndoubt be featured by its co-writer, the\nbig Little Jack Little. And so we would\nsuggest waiting for his interpretation of\nit. Looks promising indeed.\n\"CABIN IN THE COTTON”\nWritten by Parish-Perkins\nPublished by Mills Music\nEvery so often a \"way down South”\nnumber pops up, to attract considerable\nattention. This one seems to have what\nit takes to become a hit. A charming\nsong—the old log cabin in the cotton\nreaches your heart, yet as pretty as any\nSouthern number. Congratulations to\nMr. Perkins and Mr. Parish.\n\"LOVE IS THE BIG IDEA”\nWritten by Scholl-Browne-Rich\nPublished by Luz Brothers\nA sweet tune, cleverly phrased. Good\nfor summer weather. Whether or not\nyou get the idea, ’tis love—in both words\nand music. You’ll dance to this one.\n* Selections marked thus are new releases.\n'OVER THE WEEKEND”\nWritten by Washington-Monaco\nPublished by Harms\nNot a bad idea. Sentimentally perfect\nfor weekends only. This is a novelty\nalong the lines of that old timer \"On\nthe Old Back Potch.”\n\"IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL”\nWritten by Harry Barris-Arthur Freed\nPublished by De Sylva-Brown-Henderson\nCatchy tune going up the scale and\ndown again. Stops in between to arouse\nyour interest. An excellent lyric with\nplenty of rhyme. Imagine this number\nshould catch on after a little while. Al¬\nready receiving some good plugging.\n\"IN THE MYSTIC LAND OF\nEGYPT”*\nWritten by A. W. Ketelbey\nPublished by Bosworth\nA descriptive piece, very melodic.\nFollowing a short introduction, the musi¬\ncal theme unfolds with ease and beauty.\nRecommended for light programs of\neither semi-popular or concert varieties.\n\"PLEASE HANDLE WITH\nCARE”\nWritten by Stride-MacDonald\nPublished by Mario Music\nOne of the season’s best ballads. This\nnumber has \"heart appeal”—the same\nappeal as \"I Had my Heart Marked\nFragile,” and so please don’t break it\nagain, and done neatly. There should be\nno hooks to \"Please Handle with Care.”\n\"MASQUERADE”\nWritten by Loeb-Webster\nPublished by Feist\nA splendid number just a little bit\ntoo strong for the average song buyer.\nThis type of song could go all the way\nthrough the years. It ought to enjoy a\npopular run. A waltz.\n\"A GREAT BIG BUNCH OF\nYOU”\nWritten by Dixon-Warren\nPublished by Remick Music\nHarry Warren in another jolly fit of\nsong writing. A good enough number\nfor average use. In fact, kind of cute.\n\"LET’S TRY AGAIN”\nWritten by Newman-Ishnm Jones\nPublished by Feist\nA new tune with a different twist\nwhich is ingratiating indeed. It is la¬\nbeled a Fox-Trot Ballad, and that’s sen¬\nsible. It will attract listeners as either a\nvocal or a dance selection.\nIrving Fields.\nKFYR\nBismarck, N. Dak.\nStill the most logical medium for\nthe advertisers desiring a preferred\naudience in North Dakota, South Da¬\nkota, Eastern Montana, Manitoba\nand Saskatchewan in Canada.\nThis is an agricultural territory\nand the center of the American and\nCanadian hard spring wheat area,\nwhich this year appears better than\nat any time in 18 years.\nKFYR’s Territory will spend their\nmoney for advertised products and\nservice.\nA Broadcast campaign over KFYR\nwill insure your share.\nArrange a schedule now\nKFYR\nBismarck, N.
