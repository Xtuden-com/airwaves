This\nis the first attempt made in this country\nto construct or to broadcast from what\nis known as a ''live” and \"dead end”\nstudio. From one-half to two-thirds of\neach room, depending on the size of the\nstudio, will be lined with sound-absorb¬\ning material to form a \"dead end”\nwhere the microphones will be properly\nplaced to receive every note and part\nof the program which will be in progress\nat the opposite, or \"live,” end of the\nroom. The \"live end” walls will be\nconstructed of a hard material that will\nreflect the sound waves to the receiving,\nor \"dead,” end.\nAnother innovation is the zigzagging\nwalls of the two larger studios. These\nstudios are constructed with V-shaped\nwalls which will break up the sound\nwaves as they strike the sides and will\ndeflect them at various angles and\nprevent the reverberations of the notes\nfrom striking the opposite walls.\nIn order to minimize the transmission\nof extraneous sounds, special walls,\nfloors, and ceilings are being constructed.\nThe walls have no direct connection\nwith any of the outer walls for support\nor suspension except through intricate\n\"insulators” which serve to break all\nsound connections. The floors, which\nare known as \"floating floors,” are also\nfree from contact with other surfaces.\nThe studios will virtually be rooms\nwithin rooms. The ceilings will be sus¬\npended in the same manner.\nEach studio will be entered through\na vestibule which will also decrease the\npossibility of any sound entering the\nstudio during a broadcast. Special heavy-\nduty soundproof doors are being used\nthroughout.\nThe acoustical treatment in all the\nstudios will include a one and one-half\ninch rock wool blanket placed against\nthe soundproof wall and another blanket\nof the same size and style placed in\nfront of it, with a two-inch air pocket\nbetween the blankets. The outer blanket\nis covered with perforated metal. Tests\nhave shown that this method will\nproduce an ideal broadcasting studio.\nEach studio and control room window\nwill be composed of a triple sash, and\nthree panels of glass measuring y4\",\ny8\", and y8\", respectively. Each section\nof the sash and glass will be insulated\ninside and outside to stop sounds which\nmight be carried through the framing.\nThe heaviest glass, the y8\", is placed\nbetween the lighter as an added guard\nagainst sound waves caused by any\nvibration between the panels.\nThe entire WCAU system of studios\nwill be air conditioned, thus eliminating\nall windows and thereby safeguarding\nagainst the entrance of any extraneous\nnoises.\nClarifies Sports Broadcasts\nWhen Ted Husing recently described,\nover the Columbia network, the progress\nof the Olympic Rowing Trials' at Lake\nQuinsigamund, the first use was made\nof a device designed to speed up and\nclarify broadcasts of sporting events\nand others involving considerable action.\nThe device—an especially constructed\nswivel and base, supporting a pair of\nheavy binoculars, below which one of\nthe new lapel microphones is sus¬\npended—was designed by Husing and\nhis observer, Les Quailey, assisted by\nColumbia engineers.\nThis set-up, which proved extremely\nsuccessful in its inaugural trial, should\nserve to improve the efficiency of prac¬\ntically all sport event broadcasts. Husing\nestimates that the device will save from\ntwo to three seconds of each play of a\nfootball game, for instance, the time\nformerly having been lost in handling\nthe unusually large binoculars used for\nobservation.\nDuring their three years together as\na sport broadcast team, Husing and\nQuailey have perfected numerous refine¬\nments in equipment and technique, in¬\ncluding their \"annunciator” for football\nbroadcasts. This consists of a cabinet\nwith 22 strips of translucent glass bear¬\ning the names of the players of the\ntwo teams, with lights which flash be¬\nhind the glass when Quailey, who\nwatches each play through field glasses,\npresses the corresponding buttons of an¬\nother cabinet, enabling Husing to iden¬\ntify the participants involved in each\nplay without reference to numbers or\nrecognition by memory.\nRadio Good Medium\nRadio is a splendid medium for the\ncreation of direct sales, according to\nPotsie Garrett, whose beauty lectures\nhave been featured in all key cities of\nthe United States.\n\"During the latter part of May,\nwhen the hot weather was beginning to\nbe felt in the South,” says Miss Garrett,\n\"I was conducting a series of lectures\nfor the Monnig Department Store in\nFort Worth, Texas. As a means of stim¬\nulation, it was decided to hold a spe¬\ncial ELMO BEAUTY WEEK, the fea¬\nture about it being that trained Elmo\nrepresentatives would be in attendance\nat all leading stores to assist in work¬\ning out beauty problems.\n\"An opening newspaper announce¬\nment was used to call attention to the\nspecial week, and a series of lectures\nbroadcast daily, by myself, over station\nKFJZ—a talk from 10:50 until 11:00\na. m.”\n\"During that week, a splendid in¬\ncrease in volume of sales was noted,\nrunning anywhere from a 100 per cent\nincrease to almost 200 per cent in some\ninstances.\n\"Following this Special Week experi¬\nment, no advertising of any nature,\neither newspaper or radio, was used for\na period of a week. Sales dropped off\nvery appreciably.\n\"After this lapse, broadcasting was\nresumed for a period of 30 days. This\n30-day series of broadcasts started to\nclick immediately and results obtained\nwere most satisfactory, even in the face\nof the facts that, due to hot weather,\nreception was not at all good, that many\npeople were away on their vacations, and\nthat a general lassitude prevailed on\naccount of extremely hot weather.\n\"Radio is my tried and true friend,”\nadds Miss Garrett. \"I sometimes close\none of my radio talks with the statement\nto my listeners that they still have time\nto jump in their cars and come to hear\nmy noon lecture, or, if they do not feel\nlike coming down, to use their tele¬\nphone, and when I get back from the\nbroadcasting station to my Elmo booth\nand have a crowd waiting for me, with\ntheir minds already made up to buy, and\nthe telephone is busy at the same time\nwith requests that deliveries be made,\nI know RADIO IS CLICKING—NO\nFOOLIN’.”"
