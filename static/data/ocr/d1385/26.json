Only results can\nkeep any kind of advertising sold.\nHere is some of the repeat business at KFNF:\n37 months—with but 2 months not used.\n7 years (out of 8)—and on the last campaign\nthis advertiser advises us that KFNF leads\nthe list of stations for results.\n4 Seasons—and, in discussing a current cam¬\npaign, this advertiser writes, \"We have left\nthe matter up to you almost entirely in the\npast and feel we could very likely continue to\ndo so this year, if you are still interested in\nhandling our account.”\n13 months—and in this time the Salesmen of\nthis product have written 705 letters direct\nto KFNF to secure timed announcements for\ntheir Dealers.\n5 Seasons—and this advertiser once wrote us\nthat KFNF led 50 stations used.\nWe repeat, it takes results to hold advertising in any\nmedium.\nDefinite Coverage in a definite Market with a dominant\nEditorial influence accounts for such a record.\nWe will gladly send you very tangible evidence of why these\nadvertisers continue at the \"Friendly Farmer Station.”\nKFNF\nShenandoah, Iowa\nNames and addresses of all the above KFNF advertisers will be\nsent on request\n5?"
