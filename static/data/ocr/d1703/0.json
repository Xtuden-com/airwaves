He favored\ninclusion of provisions for state matching of Federal funds on a 50-50 basis (how¬\never, without giving credit for money already expended) and for state surveys and\nplans to precede any equipment grants. For this latter purpose he recommended an\nauthorization of $520, 000, with not more than $10,000 to any one state (this same\nprovision is in H.R. 932, H.R. 5099 and H.R. 5336).\nSecretary Ribicoff recommended $25,000,000 for the equipment grants (as oppos¬\ned to $52,000, 000 recommended in the various bills pending), with no limit as to how\nmuch each state might receive (proposed bills set a ceiling of $1, 000,000 per state).\nHe recommended that “construction grants be made on a project-by-project and not\na State-by-State basis,” and that “provisions be included whereby State plans may\nbe developed cooperatively into interstate or regional plans.”\nThe Secretary said, “The legislation should authorize the Commissioner of Edu¬\ncation to make grants on a project basis under priorities to be established. The\ncriteria for such priorities should be designed to achieve the prompt and effective\nuse of the available channels, equitable geographic distribution of the facilities\nthroughout the country, and the setting up of the facilities in such a way as to serve\nthe greatest number of people and broadest uses possible. We recommend an aggre¬\ngate of $25 million to be authorized over a 4-year period to pay up to one-half the\ncosts of approved projects. This would be matched by the payment of one-half the\ncosts by the individual sponsoring agency.”\nMr. Ribicoff recommended that any legislation “exclude from Federal grants clos¬\ned-circuit transmission within a single school or occupying a single site.”\nDuring the question-and-answer period following his formal statement. Secretary\nRibicoff pointed out that the recommendation for $25 million was based on an average\nof $125, 000 for each of the approximately 2 00 unactivated reserved channels. It\nwas also brought out that no per-state ceiling had been recommended because, as\nhe stated in his testimony, the purpose of the legislation is to make ETV available\nto those areas not now served, and the number of unactivated channels varies great¬\nly from state to state. Thus, some states will naturally undertake more projects than\nothers and the amount of aid needed will vary from state to state.\nHARRIS* SURVEY OF GOVERNORS CITED\nAt the outset of the above hearings. Subcommittee Chairman Moulder reported on\nthe results of the survey Chairman Harris made among the governors of all the states\nto determine each state’s readiness to participate in a cooperative Federal-State\nmatching program for the establishment of ETV facilities."
