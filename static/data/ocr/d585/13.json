Novlk\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nMunicipal Building\nNew York City\nDear Mr. Novlk:\nWe have made no attempt to secure\nany special plane rates for the NAEB Convention.\nAs you no doubt understand, our group is\nsmall and most of our members are in the\nMiddlewest and many drive to the meeting. It\nisn’t that we don’t have some come by plane,\nfor usually Howard Evans and President Crane,\nof Wyoming, take planes to the meeting.\nIf you can make it to Ames, I shall\nbe happy to see you at that time.\nCordially yours,\nFES: EH\nFrank E. Schooley\nExecutive Secretary"
