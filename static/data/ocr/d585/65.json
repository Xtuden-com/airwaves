I had a long talk with\nhim and he insists that there is no intention on their part to hold any\nof the educational stations to a strict compliance with the rule. I told\nhim that I was going to pass it on to you and he urged that, if at all\npossible, I call you on the phone so that I can explain the spirit of our\nconversation, I promised that I will, and I hope that by the time this\nreaches you, we have had our talk.\nDirector.\nMSU/cb\n\"New York City’s Own Station”—810 Kc."
