Novik\nMunicipal Broadcasting 3y3tem\nRadio Station WYNC\nNow York City\nDear Mr. Noviks\nHoward Evans thinks that NAEB should be\nrepresented at the hearing the PCC will\nopen on February 26. This hearing will\ntouch upon the ultra-high frequencies and\nin particular will hit the frequency moduÂ¬\nlation problem. If it were not so far,\nwe would send Kbel at our expense to represent\nNAEB but Wright thinks the exoense is too\nmuch for our budget. Is there any chanee\nthat Brlmberg could represent NAEB if necessary?\nCordially yours,\nFES/rep\nFrank E. Sohooley"
