Schooley\nWILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nMy dear Frank;\nHow are you getting on with the stations in connection\nwith the Victor applications? We have just sent in our's and that is\nwhy I thought I'd ask about you.\nI thought you would he interested in knowing that\nColumbia has just agreed to give us records on the same agreement\nas Victor. As far.as the license is concerned, they haven't said\nanything as yet, and of course, I won't mention it.\nI've just spoken with Howard Evans, who just got\nback from the Washington F-M Hearing. It seems that the big fellows\nare fairly well agreed on not interfering with the educational\nfrequencies. It looks as though the educational presentations will\nnot take place until the first week in April.\nOur Hearing for evening time starts on March 29th,\nwith the Mayor and will recess until April 10th to give a representative\nof th£ State of Minnesota an opportunity to present their case in\nbehalf of WCCO. Their intervention is just a duplication of the\nWCCO case about interference hazards. We hope to prove, conclusively,\nthe opposite - that there is no interference in their primary area\nand the slight interference in their secondary area is minor in\ncomparasion with the interference that exists at the present time\nfrom Louisville on 820kc and other nearby powerful channels.\nVery sincerely yours,\n—\nDirector\nP.S. Will you please send me some more of the F-M special letters -\nif you have them available. Thanks.\nMSH; c “New York City's Own Station”—810 Kc.\n114"
