Thus the Mayor used WMYC to announce every Phrase\nof the Aluminum Collection Campaign—and for such seemingly small—\nbut very necessary jobs as warning the public against alarm during\nArmy air defense manuevres.\nin summation it is well to point out that the flexibility of\nschedule inherent in the operation of a non-commercial, municipal\nstation makes it possible for WNYC to devote more spot announcements,\nmore series time, more transcription time, more \"one-shot\" time to\nthe job of building morale and aiding the defense effort than would\nbe possible under any other program structure, in it's average eleven\nhour broadcast day the city station is able to carry fifteen short\nannouncements, plus as many as three-hundred full minutes of defense\nprogramming-without overburdening the listening public or going\noverboard into periods traditionally devoted to recreation and relaxation.\nM.S.Novik, Director\nMunicipal Broadcasting system"
