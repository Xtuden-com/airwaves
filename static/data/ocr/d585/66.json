As a matter\nof fact we broadcast many programs from the classroom.\nWe feel this is one of our unique and outstanding\nservices to radio listeners.\nIn our own case we make no particular attempt to conduct\nour radio courses as classroom affairs, i.e. by enrolling\nstudents by mall. We give no credit to listeners for\nlistening to our programs nor do we arrange follow-up\nwork. Some day we may be able to undertake this expanded\nservice but the economic reason has been the chief drawÂ¬\nback for expansion along this line.\nI am sending you a copy of our printed program for the\nmonth of February and March. The annotations will give\nyou a rather definite idea about the nature of the\nprograms we now have on the air.\nYou might ask Mr. Novlk to see the last NAEB packet in\ncase the material is still available. You might find\nsome helpful information from the literature which is\ncontained in this packet.\nIf I may be of further help, please feel free to write\nme again.\nSincerely yours,\nFrank E. 3chooley\nProgram Director\nand\nExecutive Secretary\nof NAEB\nFES/rep\nEnclosure"
