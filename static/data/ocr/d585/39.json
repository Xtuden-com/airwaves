Novlk\nDirector of WNYC\nMunicipal Building\nNew York City, New York\nDear Novlk:\nThis morning I sent you the following wire:\nRCA ADVIBES LICENSE NECESSARY BY DECEMBER FIRST,\nTHINK YOU ADVISED EARLY SAID EXTENSION WOULD BE\nGRANTED NAEB MEMBERS. CM YOU GET US DEFINITE\nADVICE ’WHAT ACTION OUR STATIONS MUST TAKE\nI hope you found It possible to get in touch with\nMr, Early. Some of the members are quite worried,\nincluding WILL. Perhaps this letter of RCA-Vlctor\nwent to all radio stations, but it was my under¬\nstanding from conversation with you that an addi¬\ntional time would be granted NAEB stations.\nPerhaps Mr. Early is reluctant to put that in\nwriting.\nCordially,\nFrank E. Sohooley"
