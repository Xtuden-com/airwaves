Novik\nRadio Station WYNC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nNew York City\nDear Novik;\nA letter is going out to all of the members within\nour association which can qualify for the $12.00\nfee with ROA - Victor. For your information we\nhave some stations that operate partially on a\ncommercial basis and I am not going to bring them\nin but advise them they should do their own business\nwith RCA. For example, Cornell University leases\nmuch of its time on the oonr;eroi&l basis. Not long\nago I had a letter from Phillip wanting to know if\nthis agreement would get them under the wire on the\nbasis of a non-commercial station. I don*t see how\nthey oan expect to get by when part of the time they\nare making profit with the use of their band. I\nthink we should play fair with RCA and all others\nwho have been gratious enough to give us free lioense\nprivileges or at least a great reduction.\nI am sending you a few copies of the NAEB News Letter\non Frequency Modulation.\nIt is possible that I will get to attend the F-M Hearing\nas an NAEB representative. Matters aren*t settled but\nit looks like I will.\nThanks for your kindness.\nCordially yours,\nFrank E. Sohooley\nFES/rep\nP. 3. We have started a requisition for the payment\nof our $12.00 fee to RCA - Victor. I*m sure some of\nthe other stations have done likewise.\nfes"
