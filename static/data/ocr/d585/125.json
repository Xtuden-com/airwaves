The transcriptions there are filed on edge.\nThe envelopes in which they are stored are provided\nWITH FLAPS WHICH ARE FOLDED OVER AND THE CENTER HOLES\nARE COVERED WITH PAPER OR TAPE TO KEEP THE DUST FROM\nSEEPING IN THE ENVELOPES AND GETTING ON THE TRANSCRIPTIONS.\nIN OUR OWN CASE, WE HAVE NOT STOPPED TO FOLLOW THE STEPS\nSUGGESTED BY STEEHL BUT WE DO STORE OUR RECORDS (TRANS—\nCRlPTIONS) IN STEEL FILES, ON EDGE. WE USE THE CLOSE-\nWernicke 33 1/3 transcription drawer file*for most of\nour records have one section for filing case which\nholds approximately 2O0Cdiscs with records on edge.\nCordially\nFEsrst\nFrank E.
