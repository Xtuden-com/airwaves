The report was prepared\nrather hastily and I am therefore sure I overlooked a\ngreat deal of educational activities.\nMy point in writing is that sometime in Octo¬\nber or November, I thought a formal report of outstanding\nactivities should be submitted to Variety for their con¬\nsideration in connection with their annual report.\nWith best regards,\nMSNjsd\nNEW YORK\nWORLD'S FAIR 1940\n'New York City's Own Station\"—810 Kc."
