Joe Wright’s idea is good; in that way we\ncan formally go on record.\nThanks for the return of the BMI corres¬\npondence. You are absolutely right about not having\nour group get involved in the present scrap. It’s\na cinch we haven’t anything to lose in the long run.\nBest regards,\nMSN:sd\nNEW YORK\nWORLD S FAIR 1940\nc^dZSI\n\"New York City's Own Station”—810 Kc."
