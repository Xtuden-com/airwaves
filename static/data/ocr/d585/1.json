The University of Illinois station, WILL,\noperates daytime only on 580 kilocycles. Our present\npower Is five thousand watts. As you will note from\nthe attached printed program, we do not operate all\nhours but well over the minimum two-thirds required\nby the FOC.\nThis semester we have been broadcasting a series\nof classroom lectures by Professor Robert Phillips of\nPurdue University via WBAA. In one or two instances\nwe have rebroadcast a program from WSUX of Iowa City but\nas a regular thing the distance is too great for us to\nexpect satisfactory service.\nWe permit the rebroadcasting of any of our pro¬\ngrams bjitany other station providing it is done on\na non-commercial basis. The broadcasting program\nmay not be broken at the discretion of the commercial\nstation. For example, if a station takes a basket¬\nball broadcast from us, It must carry this game from\nbeginning to and on a non-commercial basis even though\nit does not care to aarry our Intermission program.\nWe also feed by wire other stations from time to time\nproviding they pay for wire oosts.\nPerhaps I should say that we operate a few sceclal\nperiods at* night each year for the broadcasting of\nIllinois basketball games. We operate on reduced\npower at such times.\nIf there Is additional information which I may\nsend you please do not hesitate to write again.\nSincerely yours,\nf rtff /r*o\nFrank E. Sohooley"
