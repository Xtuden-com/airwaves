Novlk\nRadio Station WYNC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nNew York City\nDear Novlk:\nConfidentially, the group at the University of\nMinnesota is a rather peculiar bunch to deal with.\nPersonally I would be very careful about what I\ntried to get through the University of Minnesota\nor any of it3 personnel. We have never been able to\nget them to Join our group although they certainly\nbelong within our classification.\nIf you want some general information, perhaps Bill\nSener, c/o W3UI, University of Iowa, Iowa City, can\nfurnish it for you. Bill spent some time with the\nUniversity of Minnesota station in Minneapolis.\nHe is a good boy and might be able to give you some\ngeneral information. Might even suggest where you\ncan get more Information regarding the situation at\nWCCO.\nCordially,\nPES/rep\nFrank E. Sohooley"
