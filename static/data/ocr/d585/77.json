SCITO\nLawrence, Kansas\nMr dear Mr. Inghaai\nw* Motion on Bxpei^ituree\nYcmr latter arrived while 1 wa# trying to locate Howard Uvaae\non the phone to diecuss with him the result of a setting that\nhe m® having with itudebaker to determine the crfMWIiiM up\nfor the educational tide at the SW hearings, Because of your\nreference to the natter of spending the $75.00 for fare, 1\ndie cue a ed that phase with Events. Me seemed to feel that the\ncase #o elmping itselfethftt there wee no need for sinking a\nspecial trip, also in flex* of the fact that he was designated ns\none of the people to appear in our behalf.\nI asked Evans to send you a note, airmail, from Washington,\ngiving you his ideas on the natter.\nMy own vote on the witter - having been in Washington last week -\nis that I aa inclined to agree with hie Judpieilt, hut I m ready\nto cast m affirmative vote for 8«hooley«e expenses, If a vote\non the matter is to he considered.\nMi TO Motion\nA« a newcomer to the MASS, I don*t know what the attitude has\nbeen toward the HOC. If it is on# of definite association, then\nI»d favor Schooley because he it in the beet position to establish\na close relationship and contact with the fRMG and Studebakerfs\noffice. Ae a matter of fact, if we go into it at all, the only\nreason I can see for doing so is in order to establish a real\nclose relationship and it might be even more advantageous if there\nwas someone who would be nearer to Washington s® that more work could\nbe done.\nHowever, that element of it not being subject to vote, i cast my\nvote for bchooley - there again, in connection with this matter,"
