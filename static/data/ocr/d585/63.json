Novik\nRadio Station WYNC\nMunioipal Broadoasting System\nNew York City\nDear Novik:\nFor gosh sakes, I wouldn’t have for the world\nbothered you in Nassau. However, I am\nreturning herewith the amended oopy of the\ncontract which RCA purposes that we accept.\nRegarding Columbia, I do not know what to\nsuggest. I presume you refer to the Columbia\nBroadcasting System and not Columbia University.\nIf it is CB3, why not find out what they have\nin mind and let them make the proposal.\nThe A3CAP business isn’t rushing and we can\nwait until Mr. Buck returns.\nYes, I got your notice on the American Musio\nFestival. Thanks a lot.\nCordially,\nFE 3/rep\nEnclosure\nFrank E. Sohooley"
