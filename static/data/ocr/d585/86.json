Novik\nRadio Station WYNC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nNew York City\nDear Novik:\nPerhaps you will recall that one of the\nproblems concerning the non-commercial educaÂ¬\ntional station is that of the restricted list\ngiven us by A.3.C.A.P. I believe that you\nwere going to see Mr. Buck at some convenient\ntime and get from him permission for us to\nuse these restricted numbers, providing they\nwere not used on the air more than once a day\nor some such agreement.\nCordially,\nFSS/rep\nFrank E. Schooley"
