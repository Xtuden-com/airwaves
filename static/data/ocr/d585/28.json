Schooley. Executive Secretary,\nThe Nat*l. Assn, of Educational Broadcasters,\nUniversity of Illinois,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nMy dear Frank:\nThe hearings in Washington have been definitely\nset for Monday, October 23rd. We had a meeting of all concerned\nlast week in New York and it seems that the attorneys would like\nto have you in Washington on Sunday just to kind of go over the\ngeneral presentation.\nI have discussed the matter of finances with\nWalter Lemmon and can assure you that the transportation and\nincidental expenses will all be taken care of and a check will\nbe available for you upon arrival.\nWe are all planning on a one day session and the\nchances are pretty slim of it going over beyond one day. Under\nany condition, it is safe for you to figure on having to spend\nonly one day in Washington, if the actual time away from the\noffice is an important element to you.\n1*11 make reservations for you at the Willard,\nunless Walter Lemmon has another place for you, and under those\nconditions, we will wire you.\nWill you send me a confirmation of this note and\nlet me know when you are arriving, etc?\nVerM sincerely yours,\n—-—’\nDirector.\nP.S. As part of your testimony, it would be advisable if you can\nhave the \"dope\" on the number of educational stations that were in\nexistence at one time, something about why they were dropped and\nhow many we have today and program difficulties and stuff\"of that\nsort. It might be \"rehashing\" but I think this will be the first\ntime that it will be given a real chance to be presented to an\n\"New York City's Own Station”—810 Kc."
