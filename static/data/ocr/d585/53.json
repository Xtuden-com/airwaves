Novlk\nRadio Station WYNC\nMunicipal Broadoasting System\nNew fork City\nDear Novlk:\nWith reference to your letter of January 19 regarding\nthe agreement with RCA - Victor, I am raising a question\nor two.\nDid you and Evans get a concession on Section I, Item B,\nwhich would require us to announce Victor or Lang-Worth\nphonograph records as used? You will recall that this\nwas one of the provisions to which some of us strenuously\nobjected. We cannot and will not announce any manu¬\nfacturers1 products over WILL. I think if this concession\nwas made during the conference we should negotiate the\nmatter if possible. If you mentioned this at the confer¬\nence and the attorney overlooked this,matter in changing\nthe license, I would suggest we get In writing from them,\nthis concession.\nSo far as the other narts of the agreement are oonoemed,\nI see no reason why every NAEB member would not be glad\nto follow the terras set forth by RCA.\nUntil I hear further from you I am holding the whole\nthing in abeyance.\nCordially yours.\nFE 3/rep\nFrank E. 3ohooley"
