I think that wou 3d be of great\nimportance to many of the smaller stations,\nI don*t know whether anyone has suggested\nPrank Kingdon, but I know he would make an excellent\nspeaker. Another good subject mi$it be the role of\nthe educational station in National Defense and the\nstatus of the station, especially in the smaller com¬\nmunities.\nIt has just come to my attention that your\ndeadline was July 15th, so take this for what it is\nworth and accept my apologies far not writing sooner.\nSine ere ly you rs ,\nDirect or\nMSN: sd\n“New York City’s Own Station”—810 Kc."
