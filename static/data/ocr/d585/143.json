But how can we justify it with\nthe FCC if it is true that the educational stations have not\nrequested the frequencies, or aren't sufficiently interested^\nI'd like to know about the educational interest because\nI'm sure it will come up at the FM meeting to be held in New York\nat the end of this month, and when it does, I'd want to have the\nanswers.\nSincerely yours.\nDirector\nMSN:sd\n168\n'New York City's Own Station”—830 Kc."
