Novik\nRadio Station WYNC\nMunicipal Broadcasting System\nNew York City\nDear Novik:\nFor the particular period at the Ohio Institute\nreserved for N.A.E.B.,,we usually have a good\nold harangue-business session. Everything else\nat the institute is planned more or less in a\nformal manner but we simply reserve one evening\nto get together and discuss our own particular\nproblems.\nDon*t be surprised at the action of the director\nof the University of Minnesota station. I tell\nyou Minnesota should belong to NAEB but apparently\nno one can break the ice.\nYes, thanks for the copy of your note to President\nIngham. I received it o.k.\nCordially,\nFES/rep\nFrank E. Schooley"
