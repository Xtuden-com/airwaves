Schooled, Executive Secretary\nThe National Association of Educational\nBroadcasting\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Sir:\nIn regard to your letter to Harold Engel concerning the\nconvention, it is very doubtful if a representative from\nthis University would he able to attend the convention\nthis year- I personally would like to go hut since the\nengineering summer session will not end until September 19\nand the fall semester begins again the 28th, and my extraÂ¬\ncurricular work, teaching Naval cadets radio, would make\nit impossible for me to get away for a long enough time to\nmake the trip.\nIf other members are considering postponing the national\nconvention, I believe that it would be advisable to do so\nfrom our standpoint.\nAs you have probably noted from the news releases, KFJM\nhas been silent during the summer. We expect to start\nour two-hour a day broadcast again when school starts this\nfall.\nYou might be interested to know that we have been doing\nsome research work here at the University on frequency modulation.\nWe are applying for a patent for a wide band single tube f.m.\nbroadcasting system. I hope in a short time to be able to\nf-elease more definite information on this patent.\nYours very truly,\nAssistant Professor of Electrical\nEngineering\nejo.ll\nBUY \"DAKOTA MAID\" FLOUR"
