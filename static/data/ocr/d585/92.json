Schooley\nExecutive Secretary\nThe National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nMy dear Franks\nI dictated a letter to you Monday which I\nhope you have by this time. H0wever, if anything\nwent wrong with it, I am completing your questionnaire.\nI h$ve an idea that the Morrison Hotel, be¬\ncause of its size and facilities, would not only be\nthe best place but give you the best concessions. You\nmight check with the Stevens Hotel as the second choice\nand the Congress as the third*\nIs there a chance of getting any of the people\nassociated with the Chicago Round Table or the University\nof Chicago? Another suggestion of mine would be a side\ntrip to WHA to look over the Wisconsin set up. I, for\none, would be interested in it, but I may be the only\none.\nYou will surely receive more answers on this\nquestionnaire and I know the convention will be a great\nsuccess.\nSincerely yours.\nDirector\nMSN:sd\nEncl-1\nNEW YORK\nWORLD’S FAIR 1939\n‘New York City’s Own Station”—810 Kc."
