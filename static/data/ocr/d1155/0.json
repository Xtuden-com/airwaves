They, along with Abbot and Owen, prefer Detroit*,\nThere is practically no objection to the October date and\nMANY FAVORING OVER LATE SEPTEMBER DATES.\nThe selection of Chicago, I would make on basis of membership\nAND POSSIBLE AND PROBABLY ATTENDANCE.\nCHICAGO - ProbablEI WSUI, WOI , WILL, WBEZ,. WBAA, WCAL, WHA,\nWNAD, Indiana, and Drake. Possible: KFJM, KWSC\nDETROIT - Probable: WNYC, WHCU, WOSU, WKAR, Michigan. Possible\nSyracuse.\nChicago is nearer for more members, almost as clos for some,\nAND FARTHER FOR FEW. DETROIT (OR EAST LaNSING; IS FARTHER FOR\nMOST, ABOUT THE SAME FOR SOME, AND NEARER FOR A FEW.\nPersonally, I think the Eastern members should be given conÂ¬\nsideration, JUST AS WELL AS WESTERN AND M|D-WESTERN. Bui, THE\nTIMES BEIN8 WHAT THEY IS, ST SEEMS MORE LOGICAL TO SELECT THE\nMOST CENTRALLY LOCATED SPOT POSSIBLE.\nThe ABOVE IS BASED upon my BEST JUDGMENT in INTERPRETING WHAT\nHAS BEEN WRITTEN TO ME. (FILES ARE OPEN FOR INSPECTION).\nSo FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, THIS IS MY LAST EFFORT TO GET THE\nFall convention under way.
