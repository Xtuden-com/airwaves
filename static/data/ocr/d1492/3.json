Ten\nminutes later the same broadcasters will\nbe arguing for increased time and power,\nor better channels, on the ground that a\nlarge percentage of their time is devoted\nto educational programs, and the Com¬\nmission lets them get away with it.\nThey state publicly that educators fail\nas broadcasters, and at the same time\nput forth every effort to make their com¬\nmercial stations the exclusive radio out¬\nlets for state departments of education,\nand for colleges and universities. The\nstation manager and chain official who\nspoke so disparagingly of educators at\na recent meeting in New York is the\nsame man whose station used its power\nof censorship with such outrageous ef¬\nfrontery that a state university discon¬\ntinued cooperation with the station. And\nan official of the Federal Radio Com¬\nmission, yielding to this man’s plea that\nhis station was rendering indispensable\neducational service, recommended that\nhis station be granted an increase of\n40,000 watts in power, while the Com¬\nmission denied the right of a high school\nin the state to use two watts power to\nbroadcast interesting school events to\nparents and taxpayers within the district.\nCollege stations have not reached the\nacme of perfection in putting education\non the air, but the reaction of listeners\nto radio advertising indicates that com¬\nmercial broadcasters are just as open to\ncriticism. Records of the college stations\nshow they have rendered useful service\nto large audiences more interested in\neducation than in mere amusement, and\nthat the service is appreciated.\nStatus—The present radio situation\nis, as Judge Robinson of the Federal\nRadio Commission told us last year, one\nthat threatens the foundations of our\ngovernment. Would we be willing to have\nthe printing presses of our country con-\ntroled by commercial concerns having\npower to determine what should and\nshould not be printed? Would we be will¬\ning to have our public schools, colleges,\nand universities in the hands of commer¬\ncial groups having power to determine\nwhat should be taught, and when these\ninstitutions should be used for public\npurposes? That is exactly similar to what\nthe commercial broadcasters and certain\nmembers of the Federal Radio Commis¬\nsion advocate we do with education by\nradio.\nRecently we heard a distinguished\nscientist, professor of an outstanding\nuniversity, tell us over a national chain\nof broadcasting stations:\nAny talk of the loss of liberty thru the\nmonopolistic control of the ether at this time\nin the United States is too grotesque to need\nto receive more than a line in an address like\nthis. Any high-school boy knows that it would\nbe very simple now, and increasingly easy as\nresearch moves on, to break such a monopoly\nif there ever appeared to be the slightest danger\nof its being created.\nOnly a few days before, the parent\ncorporation which owns that chain had\nbeen finally adjudged guilty of monop¬\noly, and of violation of the antimonop¬\noly laws of the United States. Why did\nhe ignore this fact, and the fact that the\nAttorney General of the United States\nhad instituted a suit against this same\ngreat corporation following investiga¬\ntion of its activities by the Interstate\nCommerce Committee of the United\nStates Senate?\nVested rights—The effort to secure\nvested rights for commercial radio sta¬\ntions is a further step toward monopoly\nof radio. Congressional foresight has kept\ncontrol of radio channels, theoretically,\nin the hands of the federal government.\nThe Federal Radio Commission issues\nlicenses to broadcasting stations for\nshort periods. Every license holder has\nsigned a waiver, agreeing that he has no\nrights to the use of a channel beyond\nthe period specified in the license. Never¬\ntheless, if the Commission attempts to\nrestrict or withdraw from a commercial\nstation the privileges granted by a broad¬\ncasting license, the owners usually take\nthe case into court on the plea that their\nproperty is being confiscated. If such a\ncase should happen to go to a court\nwhich believed that protection of an\ninvestment of money was more of a\nsacred duty than protection of the rights\nof citizens to keep their channels of edu¬\ncation free from commercial censorship,\na precedent might be established which\ncould be set aside only by an amend¬\nment to the Constitution. This possi¬\nbility has been foreseen, and a Senator\nwho has done much in shaping present\nradio laws stated that he will introduce\nsuch an amendment if necessary, and\nwork for its adoption. He points to the\nfact that the Eighteenth Amendment,\nalthough it affected the value of many\nmillions of dollars worth of property\ntemporarily, gave the owners of such\nproperty no right to claim damages on\nthe plea of confiscation.\nCollege broadcasting stations, which\nseeme^ to be in a desperate situation a\nfew months ago, have now some new\nhopes. Station WCAJ, Nebraska Wes¬\nleyan University, attacked by a commer¬\ncial station which wanted to take away\nits rights, received a favorable decision\nfrom the Federal Radio Commission\nafter a long and expensive struggle. Its\nbrave fight under adverse conditions won\nthe support of the state government of\nNebraska, the state delegation in Con¬\ngress, and influential organizations.\nWired radio will take away many lis¬\nteners who tire of sales talks on the air\nif its owners deliver the service claimed,\nfree from advertising, while making a\nmoderate monthly charge to the listener,\nprecluding the necessity of purchasing\nexpensive equipment.\nNewspapers, which brought radio\nbroadcasting to the attention of the pub¬\nlic and made it popular before the radio\ngroup revealed its purpose to enter the\nadvertising business and sap the life\nblood of the press, are organizing to\nforce advertising off the air. They are\npowerful and may succeed. They must\nsucceed or many of them will die, for,\naccording to their reports, already fifty-\nnine percent of their advertising income\nhas been diverted to radio.\nUnited action—Educators also are\norganized on a national basis, with head¬\nquarters and a service bureau in Wash-\nington. Key men and women in govern¬\nment, business, and the professions are\nreceiving information, and many of them\nadd their influence to the cause of un¬\ncensored education by radio as they be¬\ngin to realize its significance.\nIf advertising is driven from the air,\nbroadcasting must be supported as it is\nin all other countries—by appropriations\nfrom public funds, by philanthropy, or\nby a combination of the two. Already\ninstitutions of learning are so supported.\nWhen public funds are allotted for edu- /'N\ncation by radio, what could be more\nlogical than that broadcasting stations\nmaintained by those institutions should\nbe preferred to those that have been\noperated for private profit?\nAnyone who has faith in our demo¬\ncratic form of government must believe\nthat its citizens, when the facts are be¬\nfore them, will prefer to have education\nby radio controled by men and women\nwhom they elect to represent them,\nrather than by corporations which, while\ntheir aims and business may be perfectly ^\nlegitimate, are interested mainly in\nusing the public domain for private\nprofit.\nEducation by radio is published weekly by the National Committee on Eduction by Radio at 1201 Sixteenth Street, Northwest, Washington, D. C.\n[94]"
