Institutions of Higher Learning#\nLarge and small, generalized and specific, there exist\nnearly 200 institutions of higher learning in the six-state\narea which have been considered in this report# Despite\nindividual differences in size, emphasis, scope of teaching\nactivity, curricula offered and term of study, all are united\ntoward the common end of providing higher education to an ever-\nincreasing student body now numbering over 22U,000. Virtually\nall are accredited institutions. Those that are not are working\ntoward this goal. Faculty serving this student body numbers in\nexcess of 20,000 and represents nearly every conceivable subject\narea.\nIt is readily apparent, however, that many institutions\ndo not and cannot afford specialization or, in some cases, even\nadequate training in some of the subject areas in which they\nand their students may be interested. Therefore, in terms of\neducational programming via an existing Educational Television\nfacility located adjacent or nearby, a paucity of certain\nsubject matter for the interested community may be noted,\nwhile in other areas an abundance may prevail."
