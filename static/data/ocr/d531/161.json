Major communities such as Bemidji,\nInternational Falls, Olivia, Redwood Falls and St. James, Minnesota,\nand Spencer, Iowa, have UHF translator systems serving over 30,000\nhomes, or more than 100,000 people. The Redwood Falls translator\nsystem rebroadcasts the four Minneapolis commercial channels as\nwell as KTCA-TV, the educational channel. Educational channels\ncan be added to any of the indicated translator systems, thus ex¬\ntending coverage to areas which would probably never be reached due\nto lack of VHF channel allocations, lack of funds, or too sparse a\npopulation to warrant direct service. All of the UHF translators\nin this area are built and owned by local non-profit organizations\nand operated on donations.\nThe FCC rules allow UHF translators to rebroadcast the entire\nprogram schedule of the received station and do not permit local\noriginations at the translator. Recently the F.C.C. issued a tem¬\nporary construction permit for testing of local origination of\neducational programs on two UHF translators at Salt Lake City, Utah.\nThese permits were issued to the licensee of a VHF educational tele¬\nvision station.
