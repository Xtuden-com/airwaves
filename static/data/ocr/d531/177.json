  "text": "e. Regional instead of merely parochial programs\nwould become possible.\nf. A pattern for a national educational network mi^it\nbe developed which would be of great value to the nation\neducationally. At the very least, the pattern would\nbe very useful for other regional networks in other\nareas.\ng. The existence of a network would in itself provide\na strong stimulus for the establishment of additional\neducational television stations.\nh. Because of the likelihood of the possible duplicate\nuses of such microwave qualities (as -would be estab¬\nlished to implement such a network) for educational\nradio stations (particularly FM) as well, a new type\nof educational use and integration of both television\nand radio would be suggested.\nIf these and other desirable results might accrue from\nthe establishment of a regional network, why is such a network\nnot already established? The answer lies in the facts that:\na. No one knows what the program resources of the\narea are (or might be if more stations were established).\nb. No one knows what pattern the engineering (in¬\ncluding routing) of the network should follow.\nc. No one knows what the cost of the establishment\nof such a network would be.\nd. No one knows what the cost of the operation of\nsuch a network might be."
