It would require two sets of tapes, or $14,000, using\none for playback while instructing, and the second set for recording\nthe course to be used for the following term. At $14,000 per course\nfor each station, it is obvious that storing huge quantities of\ninformation is prohibited by tape cost.\nShould an independent educational network be built, it\nwould, in all likelihood, be used extensively for the purpose of\nshuttling pre-recorded material to other points where the programs\nwould again be recorded for later release. In other words, it\nwould serve in lieu of actually transporting tape from a duplica¬\ntion center.\nThis together with the enrichment and spontaneity which\nsegments of live and timely program material provide, would make\na network medium extremely valuable. The microwave circuits will\nvery likely carry ever increasing quantities of recorded material,\nthus integrating the magnetic tape recorder and the microwave net¬\nwork into an economically feasible distribution system.\nAt present we have inquiries out among the commercial television\nnetworks soliciting information to the extent of which television\ntape may have permitted reductions in circuit-mile-hours of micro-\nwave or cable procurements. This may serve as a guide to the entire\nfuture of circuit transmission versus syndication of recorded programs.\nThe Columbia Broadcasting System Television Network which makes\nvast use of television magnetic recording facilities in its operation,\nhas not seen fit to reduce its circuit-mile-hours of microwave or\ncable usage. This is an indication that the commercial networks are\ncontinuing to use microwave and cable facilities as their principal\n160"
