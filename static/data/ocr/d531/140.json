  "text": "System and is not as fully equipped a station as would be desired\nfor active network origination. The station presently uses vidicon\ncameras in conjunction with a low powered transmitter on a small\ntower. The transmitting site could be moved to a point west of\nDes Moines near Dallas Center in order to reduce overlap in cover¬\nage with Iowa City. The Sioux Falls channel 11 assignment limits\nthe distance that this site may be moved.\n6.2.4 Iowa City - ( ) Channel # 12 (inactive. Reserved).\nPresumably the State University of Iowa would operate this\nstation. The University has well equipped studio facilities and\nwould need only a transmitting plant to become operational.\n6.3 State of Minnesota - Channel by Channel Considerations.\n6.3.1 General.\nThree VHF educational reservations are available with one\nof them on the air. There are no additional VHF channels available\nas a drop-in and no unused commercial channels in the uncovered areas.\n6.3.2 Appleton - ( ) Channel # 10 (inactive. Reserved).\nThis station is located on the main microwave loop. Since\nthere is no major educational institution in the immediate area, it\nis recommended that this station be equipped as a satellite station.\nIts location is desirable for providing service to the presently un¬\ncovered area of western Minnesota. This site is a connection point\nto the North Dakota branch leg of the microwave system. At present\nno equipment or other facilities exist at this point; therefore, a\ncomplete transmitting station (less studio apparatus) should be\nplanned.\n13U"
