Drop-in).\nWhile Rapid City is remotely located from the main micro-\nwave loop, it is a community which has had very rapid growth. A\nlarge air base located at Rapid City helps to make it one of the\nlarger populated areas of the state. The South Dakota School of\nMines is located in Rapid City but because of its remoteness, this\nstation is planned as a \"transmitter only\" operation and if constructed.\n139"
