  "text": "Most of this is custom built according to AT8.T*s laboratory speci¬\nfications and the expense would prohibit its use.\nAnother factor which has not been mentioned up to this point\nis the matter of transmitting color video information through the\nsystem. While certain technical compromises might be accepted in\na network of this type, as far as less than perfect black and white\ntransmission is involved, the problems of color transmission through\nother than the shortest interstation paths will be compounded rapidly.\nSince it can be argued that color, as an information bearing\nelement, could be exploited in a large degree to convey necessary\neducational material, this factor should not be considered merely\nas a luxury or esthetic refinement. One need but refer to the vital\nrole which color slides and film play in the classroom and labor¬\natory to see the implication of color in educational television.\nThese sharply contrast the novelty aspects of color in commercial\ntelecasting. In all likelihood, color will become an increasingly\nvaluable working tool in educational television.\nSince magnetic recorders can now be equipped for color, it\nwould seem that a microwave system which falls short in this re¬\nspect might impair the potential of their future use in disseminating\nmaterial of a scientific nature; medical research is only one of\nthese. Accordingly, consideration may well be given to this in setting\nstandards for a microwave system as is being studied in this project.\n109"
