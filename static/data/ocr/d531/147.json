  "text": "University has been very active in both educational radio and tele¬\nvision and presumably would be a major contributor to the educational\nnetwork. Madison is a network junction where eastern educational\ncircuits, stratovision, or other area networks could join the\nUpper Midwest. WHA-TV has a well equipped studio with a low powered\ntransmitter radiating from a small tower. While the UHF coverage\nis limited, it may not be economically possible to increase coverage\nby improving the transmitter equipment and tower height. Additional\nfunds have not been shown in this report as further study seems in¬\nevitable .\n6.7.3 Milwaukee - WMVS-TV, Channel # 10^ (Active, Reserved).\nThe Board of Vocational and Adult Education is the licensee\nof this channel which has a very complete television facility. WMVS\nprovides service to a very heavily populated area and would presumably\nbe a very active participant in the network operation. This station\nwould require no additional funds under this study.\n6.8 VHF Transmitting and Studio Equipment Costs.\n6.8.1 General Considerations.\nThe station equipment costs are full list price using a\ntypical station equipment list and do not include the usual 10%\neducational discount. The transmitter and studio costs include an\nestimate for buildings and land for each.\nSatellite stations having a \"transmitter only\" operation,\nare equipped with a minimum of video and audio equipment for the\norigination of test pattern and for audio test or local announcements.\nThe studio equipment consists of two image orthicon cameras\nand a vidicon film chain with switching equipment and accessories.\nIhl"
