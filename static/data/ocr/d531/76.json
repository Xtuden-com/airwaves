  "text": "The accelerating demand upon educational program resources\nmay be expected to take the form of increasing not only the\nnumbers of programs but the quality of programs as well. More\nexperience will yield higher quality, and the experimentation\nin wider areas of subject matter will result in regular presen¬\ntation of a greater number of subjects# To teach or communi¬\ncate by television will be an intrinsic mandate to secure the\nmost capable teachers and communicators. Accomplishment of the\ntriple goals of more programs, better programs and more diver¬\nsification of subjects will require constant searching for the\nbest teacher, the best techniques of presentation and the addi¬\ntional subject areas. Not all this may be found at one insti¬\ntution or single source. Therefore, new resources will be\ndeveloped at perhaps hitherto overlooked points.\nEvidence already exists in tangible form of actual \"sharing\"\nby school systems and colleges of educational resources, with\ntelevision acting as the medium for the exchange. It can be\nanticipated that vastly increased amounts of sharing and ex¬\nchange of resources will be the key to future program develop¬\nment"
