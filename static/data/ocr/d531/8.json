  "text": "General Considerations\nAfter exhaustive study and investigation, it can now be\nfairly and definitely stated that a six-state, interconnected\n(micro-wave), educational television network is entirely possible\nfrom an engineering or technical point of view. Such a network,\nusing only educational stations now on the air and additional VHF\nreserved channels already allocated to education by the FCC, would\nserve almost 10,000,000 people â€” or almost three-quarters of the\npeople within the six states. Additional allocations and the use\nof UHF channels could raise this tremendous total to an even higher\nfigure.\nSuch a network is considered highly desirable by thousands of\ncitizens of the area, including business men, educators, labor,\nprofessional and community leaders* It is obvious the network\nwould encourage the establishment of more Educational Television\nstations and enable those on the air to broadcast more, (and higher\nquality), programs at little or no extra cost. The educational\nadvantages of this are obvious.\nThe capital cost of establishing such a network would be\napproximately $2,000,000, Divided among six states, this would\nentail an average expenditure less than that required by the average\nelementary school in most states*\nThe operating costs for such a network (twenty^-five hours per\nweek) would be approximately $500,000 per year, or an average of\nless than $100,000 per state* It should be noted that these costs\nare conservatively estimated and that savings in both capital and\noperating costs are entirely possible*\n2"
