  "text": "PART V\nSTUDY OF TOPOGRAPHICAL DATA ON NETWORK ROUTES\n5.1 Description of Data Collected.\nTo date, some 44 individual topographical profile maps have\nbeen prepared for the purpose of studying transmission paths in\nthe system. This work is continuing, and ultimately each of the\nmicrowave paths will be charted. For sake of a typical illustration,\none of these maps is attached hereto and serves to represent the type\nof information which the final project report will provide. Topo¬\ngraphical data presented on these maps is based upon information\ncontained in U.S. Geological Survey Maps for the various geographic\nareas.\nA second phase of the topographical study has just commenced.\nThis consists of radio altimeter proof-checking each of the paths by\nmeans of aircraft flight, precisely along the actual transmission\npath. The K & M Beechcraft Bonanza has been equipped for this pur¬\npose by the installation of a military type APN-1 instrument which\npermits accuracy in the order of roughly 10 feet, since readings are\ntaken only when barometric pressure conditions are consistent over\nrelatively wide areas.\n5.2 Sample Topographical Map.
