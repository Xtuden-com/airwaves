  "text": "Thus, two interrelated factors must be considered in viewing\npotential network program resources from the institutions of\nhigher learning in the region, particularly as concerns students\nenrolled in such institutions and with consideration, too, given\nthe general audience in the surrounding communities. The factors\nare:\n1) The indication of unique and special program resources\nwithin an institution.\n2) The indication of those basic subjects which, as coarse\nofferings common to nearly all institutions or as general\nprogramming of regional interest, could be presented\nin the best possible manner to a greater number of students\nand to wider general audiences through cooperative use\nof the best available resources.\nThese resources may be revealed by the presence of a singular\nresearch facility and its staff, an experimental educational pro¬\ngram, an excellent chorus, talented musicians in residence, indi¬\nvidual teachers who are recognized authorities in specialized\nareas, or simply a gifted teacher who, through talent and ex¬\nperience, has demonstrated an unusual ability to communicate\nover television.\nAlthough traveling to each of the institutions of higher\nlearning in the six states would have been Impossible, the in¬\nformation gained through over thirty separate visits to such\ncenters of learning, coupled with other direct communication\nand correspondence with many more, merely documented the obvious\nexpectation that there exists, within the six states1 Colleges\nand Universities, a vast number of unique educational experiences\nnow largely available only to those in attendance.\n43"
