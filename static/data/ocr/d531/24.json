  "text": "Methods of meeting these costs -within each state might vary*\nThe simplest and perhaps most efficient method might be by direct\nlegislative appropriation to an appropriate state agency (State\nBoard of Education, State Educational Television Commission, etc*)\nfor this purpose* It is possible, however, that some sort of\ndivision of cost between the \"using agencies\" (school districts,\ncolleges, etc*) might be preferred in certain states* This might\ncomplicate payment to the network considerably but it was believed\nby our consultants that this could be worked out on a contractual\nbasis without serious difficulty* It should be noted also that\ninclusion of the secondary networks would greatly increase operating\ncosts for the states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska.\nFurther economic notes may be in order* If each station now\noperating gave as little as five hours per week of its programming\nto the network some twenty-five hours per week would be available\nto each new Educational Television station coming on the air* If\na new station operating twenty-five local hours per week spends\n$100,000 per year it could double its program schedule (and there¬\nfore its service to the people of its area) for less than $2,000\nper year in extra power cost* There are very few areas in educa¬\ntion or in business where a 100$ gain in service can be financed\nby a two percent rise in costs. The financial efficiency of a net¬\nwork, which applies to educational as much as to commercial tele¬\nvision, is, therefore, almost as Important a factor to be considered\nby educators and legislators as is its educational efficiency."
