  "text": "As pointed out in other portions of this study, the necessity\nfor unit control of both technical operations and traffic matters\nstrongly suggests a structure based on common carrier principles.\nIn this case, microwave frequency assignments and construction permits\ncould be sought under the Rules and Regulations governing Point to\nPoint Microwave Service, Rule 21.700.\n2.4 Performance Prospectus and Anticipated Service Requirements\nof the Network.\nThe performance of the microwave network under study herein,\njudged from a strictly engineering point of view, is difficult to\nspecify. It is rather certain that stations along the network that\nare adjacent to an originating station will receive rather high grade\nservice which may well equal or conceivably exceed the performance of\nAT&T \"long-haul\" circuits.\nStations which lie at extreme points on the network route and\nfurthest from an originating station will receive picture quality\nwhich by an industry definition may be considered \"impaired.\" This\nlevel of impairment will vary progressively as the distance between\nthe originating station and the point of utilization varies.\nIt is therefore entirely possible that the worst level of\nimpairment will not produce a lower picture quality than that seen\nin kinescopes of moderate quality, assuming that the station selects\nthe best of the two simultaneous feeds existing on the network.\nSome guidance in this matter can be obtained by reference to a\nseparate report by John Klindworth based on observations made at\nthe terminals of long microwave circuits in North Dakota.
