  "text": "on the main network circuit.\nStations are designated as ’'Primary\" or \"Secondary\" depending\nupon their location and function as part of a regional educational\nnetwork. VHF station transmitting and studio equipment costs have\nalso been separated into \"Primary\" and \"Secondary\" categories.\nThe Primary costs are those essential for each state for\ncompletion of the primary microwave loop and branch circuits. The\nprimary stations must be built before the primary microwave system\ncan be completed and operated as a regional network.\nThe Secondary costs are for those stations to which it is\nnecessary to give more extensive service within each state, thus,\nfunctioning as part of a state network. These stations are not\nessential to the microwave regional network and may be built at a\nlater date as demand requires or as funds become available.\nSome of the stations in both Primary and Secondary groups,\nare \"transmitter only\" or satellite installations and are not equipped\nfor origination of local programs. Satellite stations can rebroad¬\ncast only the programs received on the network or a local test pattern\nfor maintenance.\nThe information on additional channel availability was supplied\nby Mr, Cy Braum of the J.C.E.T. It must be remembered that these\nadditional channels could be requested for educational use. The\navailabilities may be changed by request for use by others, or by\nactivation of channels in adjacent states which may affect the separ¬\nation. If any of the unreserved channels are desired, immediate\naction should be taken. Any delayed action on requesting reservation\nof unused channels may require additional study on availability.\n131"
