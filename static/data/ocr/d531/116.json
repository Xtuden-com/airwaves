  "text": "PAR I III\nMICROWAVE NETWORK DESIGN AND CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES\n3.1 General Considerations.\nThe microwave system proposed for Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska,\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin is divided into two\nbasic groups and referred to as primary and secondary. The pri¬\nmary section of the system consists of a complete closed loop, 2\nway system, serving the primary VHF stations. All of the primary\nstations and the primary parts of the microwave system must be\ncompleted and put into operation for the system to be used as a\nnetwork.\nFor coverage outside of the primary area, additional VHF\nchannels have been added along with single direction microwaves\nusing off-the-air pickups. These additional coverage facilities\nare listed as secondary equipment and secondary cost.\nIt should also be noted that the combined primary and secondary\nsystems give each state its own state network service and VHF\ncoverage. Individual state systems will allow each state to build\nits own system and to later join a regional network by integrating\nany portion of the microwave loop into a regional network operation .\nState division of the primary network and separate state net¬\nworks allows each state to proceed as funds permit and according to\neach state*s needs. An individual state which can obtain funds\ncould build its portion of the microwave system and use it as a\nstate network until a regional network is put into service.\nAs far as can be determined at this time, the basic structural\nelement in the proposed network serving stations in the Upper Midwest\nArea should embody a closed loop of repeaters.
