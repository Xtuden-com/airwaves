However, the maintenance\nman would not renew the contract for this value after the second year\nbecause of the large amount of travel required to maintain the system.\nThe actual number of hours required to repair a particular difficulty\nin the system was reasonable once the faulty repeater could be deter¬\nmined, but it was often necessary to start at the first site and go\nthrough the complete system to isolate troubles. Although fault\nindicating equipment was employed in this system it only showed actual\noutages and was of no help in locating qualitative troubles which\ncaused picture degradation such as microphonics, sync compression,\nlow frequency smear, etc. This experience indicates that extra tele¬\nmetering of information may well reduce travel time of high cost\nmaintenance personnel, outage time and other expenses.\nAnother installation involving 7 hops employed one full time\nmaintenance man who lived near one of the intermediate sites and\nmaintained five of the seven hops. Each of the end hops were main¬\ntained by personnel from the terminal stations. This system has been\nin service approximately three years and has improved its picture\nquality and reliability considerably over this period of time.\nAs in any complex electronic system, it can be expected that\nmaintenance requirements will be higher the first year or two until"
