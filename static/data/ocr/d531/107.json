  "text": "assured, a third phase of engineering study will be required. At\nthat time it will be necessary to re-examine the network design in\nthe iight of any new technical developments as well as possible\nchanges in the general economy.\nThe third phase of the engineering study will involve at least\nthe following!\n1. Detailed examination of performance data on newer equipment.\n2. Preparation of written specifications and other material\nrelated to bid-letting.\n3. Preparation of Application for Construction Permit covering\nmicrowave repeater stations as well as allocation matters\ninvolving the Federal Communications Commission and other\ncivil agencies.\n4. Engineering participation in connection with securing\nsites, access, utilities, etc.\n5. General Engineering Supervision of Network Construction\nand liaison with Prime Contractors.\n6. Proof of Performance Measurements during and after the\nperiod of constructions.\n7. Preparation and filing of performance data and Station\nLicense Applications with the F.C.C.\n2.2 Organization.\nIt is difficult to envision that a facility as complex as the\nnetwork to be described could operate efficiently without central\nadministration and engineering supervision, at least along circuits\ncomprising the principal loop. While it may be possible that exÂ¬\ntensive segments of responsibility for maintenance could be delegated\n101"
