Rules and Regulations governing\nCommon Carrier Television frequency assignments con¬\ncerning the possible inclusion of audio subcarrier\nassignments for service to non-television users.\nB. Investigation of F.C.C. Rules and Regulations governing\nSTL frequency assignments concerning the possible in¬\nclusion of audio subcarrier assignments for service to\nnon-television users.\nC. Investigation of costs and allocation factors for a\nseparately licensed audio information bearing network\nutilizing and sharing identical sites, towers, and\nother useable features of a projected television net¬\nwork.\nFrom a strictly technical point of view, the coordination of\nsupplementary audio sub-carriers into video microwave apparatus\nshould not be too difficult. However, it is likely that supplemen¬\ntary apparatus required to provide this service could not be\nfinanced through federal funds unless re-interpretation of the law\nis secured. Furthermore, the various allocation factors involved\nwould have to be explored with the Federal Communications Commission."
