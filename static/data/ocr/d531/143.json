The rest of the state would\nhave distribution of the network signals but would not be depended\nupon for local originations.\n6.5.2 Bismarck - ( ) Channel # 3 (inactive. Drop-in).\nBismarck has only a Junior College; however, it has the\nprominence of being the state capitol. This station would be a\n\"transmitter only\" type, fed from Fargo by off-the-air pickup and\nsingle direction microwave system.\n6.5.3 Dickinson - ( ) Channel # 4 (Inactive,\nCommercial).\nThis is a commercial channel which would have to be re¬\nserved by petition for educational use. Dickinson has a State Teachers\nCollege. However, it is doubtful that they would originate local\nprograms so this station is also considered a satellite having \"trans¬\nmitter only\" fed from Bismarck by off-the-air pickup and through a\nsingle direction microwave.\n6.5.4 Fargo - ( ) Channel # 13 (inactive. Drop-in).\nIt is understood that a petition is being prepared requesting\nreservation of this channel. North Dakota Agricultural College is\nlocated at Fargo and could be a major contributor to the network.\nBoth transmitter and studio equipment are proposed since this station\nwill be on a main microwave leg allowing its programs to be fed in\neach direction.\n6.5.5 Grand Forks - ( ) Channel # 2 (Inactive Reserved).\nIt is proposed that a fully equipped station will be es¬\ntablished at this point for local program origination, presumably\nby the University of North Dakota.
