Systematic Adult Instruction, Credit and Non-credit\nCourses\nThirty-one different subject areas encompass the one hundred\nand fifty-four separate credit courses telecast in the six states;\nthe five most frequently appearing being Education, Psychology,\nSociology, History, and Philosophy. The first five, when ranked\nby total number of programs devoted to each subject area are:\nPsychology, Education, History, Philosophy and Government.\nTabulation of all credit courses, compiled by using the listed\ncourse title, can be found in Appendix 2 •\nIt should be noted that the use of course titles alone\n(the only information available in many cases) does not indi¬\ncate the diversity of subject matter. For example, the sub¬\nject area shown as \"Education” may include \"Problems in Reading”,\n\"Group Evaluating Techniques\", etc. Even so, the span of subject\nmatter listed shows that program resources are in no way limiited\nto a few specialized subjects.\nOne hundred and five separate adult non-credit courses are\nincluded in the thirty-one subject areas having been telecast\nin the Six States; the five most often presented being Psychology,\nLiterature, Home Finance, Agricultural Subjects and Government.\nThe tabulation of these programs (Appendix 2 ) reveals the\nvariety of subjects that have been available to adults who are\ninterested in continuing education."
