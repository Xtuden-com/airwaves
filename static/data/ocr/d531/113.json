  "text": "good quality can be obtained through an off-the-air pickup\nfeeding eleven hops of STL equipment as used between Fargo\nand Williston. Again, there was strong comment from Williston\nstation engineers regarding the degradation of picture qual¬\nity, since the economy service was instituted from Minneapolis.\nPrevious to that time, their network picture had been consider¬\nably better.\nReliability of their network service is approximately 95%.\nThere is an automatic provision in the system by which\nWilliston can use a picture directly from Minot or the system\ncan use the off-the-air signal of Bismarck in case of micro-\nwave failure on the first two hops out of Bismarck. When\nsuch an additional off-the-air signal is added to the system,\nthere is further degradation of the picture.\nIn general, the picture quality through the 18 microwaves\nand two off-the-air pickups was above expectations and was\nvery useable as well as being quite reliable. It appears\nthat the first few hops of the microwave system cause the\ninitial degradation in picture resolution. As the system was\nextended, additional loss in picture quality was hardly notice¬\nable. This is undoubtedly related directly to the bandwidth\ncapabilities of the microwave system operating with off-the-air\npickups. It is generally not too difficult to maintain 2 to\n3 me. bandwidth which the final picture appeared to have at\nWilliston."
