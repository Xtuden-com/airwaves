  "text": "Introduction\nUnder terms of a Grant by the Louis W. and Maud Hill Family\nFoundation to the National Association of Educational Broadcasters,\nKTCA-TV was directed to prepare a Network Plan for a six-state\neducational television network if, indeed,such a network should be\ndetermined both feasible and desirable. This directive was given\nand the grant made after considerable preliminary discussion on the\nsubject had culminated in a resolution by Region IV of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters. This resolution requested\naction by the Regional Director toward implementing a comprehensive\nstudy of the feasibility of such a six-state educational network.\nThe Grant to the National Association of Educational Broadcasters\nby the Louis W. and Maud Hill Family Foundation made this requested\nstudy possible.\nIt will be noted that the Network Plan, as presented here, is\nactually a compilation and abridgement of three different sections\nwhich follow it in the complete report, namely, the Administrative\nPlan, the Program Study and the Engineering Survey. These three\nsections contain all the necessary documentation for statements made\nin the Network Plan, as well as the necessary technical and statis¬\ntical information which would be required to establish a Network.\nUnder the terms of the Grant, distribution of the report will\nbe made to each legislator, state officer, and major educational\nadministrator in each of the six states, as well as to other promin¬\nent community leaders. Their comments, questions and criticisms\nare invited and desired.\n1"
