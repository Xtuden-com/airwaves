  "text": "projected microwave system is to be constructed to serve supplementary\ntelevision activities over and above those of a strictly broadcast\nnature, a common carrier type of frequency allocation and license\nstructure should be sought. This form of license does not dis¬\ntinguish between closed circuit and broadcast service and would be\nconsistent with actual usage.\nThe ultimate need for transmitting color through network cir¬\ncuits also has implications in closed circuit service. There are\nalready numerous medical centers throughout the country which\nutilize color television as a basic teaching tool. These centers,\nusually located at major colleges and universities, would very likely\nbe the first to solicit color transmission through a network, should\nit be made available for closed circuit purposes.\n7.2 Service to Supplementary Satellite Stations for Extension\nof Coverage.\nWhile VHF station assignments give potential coverage to most\nof the heavily populated regions, there is still a considerable amount\nof uncovered area in the Upper Midwest which should have some future\nplans. There are various means by which television service may be\nextended to these areas. Particular concern should be given to ex¬\ntending service to points where there are key educational institutions.\nIn general, the microwave system was planned so that a microwave\nsite is close to such towns as Winona, Minnesota; LaCrosse, Wisconsin;\nDubuque and Grinnell, Iowa; all of which have important college in¬\nstitutions which could make definite use of the educational programs.\nIn the future some of these colleges may become technically capable\n151"
