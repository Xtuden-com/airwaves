WDAY formerly received NBC net¬\nwork service through a closed loop AT&T microwave system in\nwhich nine hops of TD-2 equipment gave them very satisfactory\nservice in both picture quality and reliability. During\nthe last year this service was made more economical through\nuse of an off-the-air pickup of Minneapolis NBC programs\nfeeding six hops of TD-2 equipment and one hop of Motorola\nSTL.\nThe television station engineers and viewers in the area\nhad noticed impairment in picture quality when the switch\nto an off-the-air pickup was made. My personal evaluation\nof the picture quality was that the signal contained con¬\nsiderable high frequency noise which was probably produced\nby sound sub-carrier. There was a small amount of low-\nfrequency smear as well as slight picture flutter present.\nThe CBS picture at KXJB-TV showed slightly less noise or\nreduced bandwidth plus considerable picture smear and a\ndefinite loss of high frequencies. KXJB uses both CBS and\nABC pictures and stated that the ABC quality was generally\nbetter, with the variations probably due to the pickup\nreceiver at Zimmerman, Minnesota. As receivers are changed,\nthe quality will change radically. In general, the pictures\n105"
