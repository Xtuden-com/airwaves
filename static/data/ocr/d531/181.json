  "text": "proposals in the following highly important respects:\n1* The £>puthern Regional Education Board is a quasi-\ngovernmental organization unique in this country. The\nnetwork proposed would be operated by this already ex¬\nisting board, created for other purposes. Its proposals\nhave little relevance to regional planning where no such\norganization exists.\n2. Educational television is only one aspect of the\nactivities of the Southern Regional Education Board.\nIt cannot devote its full energies to educational tele¬\nvision nor does it propose to do so.\n3. Many states represented in the Southern Regional\nEducation Board have no educational television stations\nand comtemplate none at this time. Because of this and\nbecause of the political necessity of including all\nstates in the plan, the Southern Regional Education\nBoard plan calls for the inclusion of \"production cen¬\nters\" and closed-circuit television facilities within\nthe network.\nIt. The Board's plan, therefore, is essentially a\n\"closed-circuit\" plan. This, again, differs greatly\nfrom the present proposal which confines itself solely\nto a network of television and radio stations, and\nactual broadcast interchange.\n17U"
