The\nfirst technical evaluation concerning the feasibility of the\nnetwork being considered was contained in a brief preliminary\nreport prepared by KTCA-TV in December, 1958, and for general\nappraisal in states comprising the NAEB Upper Midwest Area.\nThe second and more comprehensive technical inquiry con¬\ncerning this project commenced in June, 1959, when work began on\nthe intensive engineering that culminates with this report. Material\nincluded herein has been developed to the point of providing re¬\nliable cost estimates which can be used in the course of securing\ncapital funds and operating budgets for a functioning network.\nThese estimates are by necessity based upon current conditions\nas to costs of all types as well as to the present state of the art\nin equipment design. There is on the horizon scientific develop¬\nments which might conceivably alter the design of a network in\neither of several directions. These could possibly add to the\ncosts shown while providing superior service or, conversely, might\nreduce costs somewhat while still providing service of a degree\nequal to that outlined in this report.\nWhen and if funds of the magnitude outlined herein are reasonably\nm\nj.\nJ\nj\nU\n100"
