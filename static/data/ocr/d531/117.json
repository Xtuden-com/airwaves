  "text": "this loop there are branch circuits feeding the Duluth-Superior\nstation, the stations in Fargo and Grand Forks, N.D., and WMVS-TV\nin Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Duluth-Superior leg joins the loop\nat Minneapolis-St. Paul; the Fargo-Grand Forks leg joins at the\nAppleton, Minnesota station; and Milwaukee joins at WHA-TV in\nMadison, Wisconsin. All circuits tentatively proposed provide\nfor two way transmission (primary origination and reception of\nnetwork programs) by participating educational stations. The\nsecondary branch extensions could not originate programs unless\nthis portion of the circuit was augmented to include two way trans¬\nmission.\nAs will be pointed out with more detail in a later section of\nthis report, the present state of the art in available microwave\napparatus leaves much to be desired where a system of this scope\nis being considered. While it is reasonably certain that useable\npicture quality will be provided throughout the system, this level\nof quality will not equal that of a high quality live television\npickup.\nThe geographical location of the majority of the VHF reservations\nprovides a loop in which it would be desirable to be able to have\na microwave system capable of transmitting in either direction be¬\ntween adjacent stations. Transmission in either direction, theoret¬\nically could be accomplished through use of a single system whose\ndirection could be reversed by remote switching. Transmission in\neither direction can also be provided by a dual system giving simul¬\ntaneous, two direction service between adjacent stations.\nIn order that transmission through the many repeaters involved\n111"
