  "text": "An unexpected response appeared dm discussing the second\nclassification of programs which would be most welcome from a\nnetwork. The many expressions indicating a strong desire for\nmore in-school programs, even from those already presenting\nrelatively large amounts of school programming, were not anti¬\ncipated. This general attitude may well be concommitant to\nthe very rapidly growing interest in the use of television in\nschools and, although this evidence does not warrant any major\nconclusions, it is worthy of note in this study. Although the\nneeds for out-of-school presentations directed toward pre-school\nand school age youngsters are being adequately met m some\nlocalities, in others there was a wish for added programming\nof this kind.\nThe desire was expressed, although with little discussion\nof specific subject matter, for adult level systematic instruc¬\ntion programs, particularly for college credit courses of the\nquality that could be afforded through network exchange.\nIdeas for specific kinds of series which could be imple¬\nmented through network interchange were advanced during the\ndiscussions. The production in each of the local areas of\nappropriate local segments of series built around themes of\ncommon regional interest was suggested as a potentially desir¬\nable adjunct to local programming.\nMany \"special\" programs, such as dramatic productions,\nrelatively large amounts of preparation time and hence\nappear infrequently if at all on local stations.
