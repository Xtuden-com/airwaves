  "text": "APPLICATION TO THE LOUIS 77. AND MUD HILL FAMILY FOUNDATION\nBY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\nFOR A GRANT TO SUPPORT A PROJECT DESIGNED TO FURTHER THE\nEVENTUAL ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\nNETWORK\nI. Project Title: A Study of the Steps Necessary to Establish\na Regional Educational Television Network.\nII. The Problem: In the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota,\nIowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska, though their\narea is not so densely populated as that of some other states,\nfive television stations devoted to education now operate.\nThese are: KTCA-TV (Minneapolis-St. Paul), KUON-TV (Lincoln,\nNebraska), WHA-TV (Madison, 77isconsin), 7/MVS-TV (Milwaukee,\n7/isconsin), and 7701-TV (Ames, Iowa). The first four of these\nstations operate on channels reserved for education; the fifth,\nowned by Iowa State College, operates on a commercial channel,\nbut pioneered in educational broadcasting. All of these staÂ¬\ntions are broadcasting live educational programs but none is\ninter-connected by microwave transmission to any of the others.\nThere are additional VHF channels reserved for education at\nDuluth, Minnesota; Minot and Grand Forks, North Dakota; Brookings\nand Vermillion, South Dakota; and Des Moines and Iowa City, Iowa.\nThere is also a very strong possibility that an additional VHF\nchannel will be reserved in the area of Appleton, Minnesota,\nwhich is located some two hundred miles due 77est of Saint Paul.\nIn addition, there are eighteen unused, reserved UHF channels\nin the six states.\n168"
