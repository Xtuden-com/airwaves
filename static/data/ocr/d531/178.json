No sustained consideration, on the basis of care¬\nful investigation, has been given to an administrative\nand policy structure under which such a network might\noperate•\nIt appears reasonable that few legislatures, private\nfoundations or state departments of instruction are likely\nto recommend establishment of a regional network or expen¬\nditure of funds on any part of such a network until answers\nto these problems are provided. Such answers can be given\nonly on the basis of a thorough study of the steps which must\nbe taken to establish a regional network.\nIII. Objectives: The principal objective of this study\nwould be to provide to the governors, state officers, legis¬\nlators and educational administrators (including state and\nprivate college regents and trustees) of each of the six states,\nthe following information:\na. A practical engineering plan for the establishment\nof the regional network, with a schedule of costs for\neach state’s participation in the network. (Alternate\nroutes and costs must be clearly indicated. The uses\nof video tape in connection with such a network must\nbe investigated and included.)\nb. A listing of program resources presently (and\npotentially) available to the network in order that\nno legislator or administrator might be in doubt as\nto what his constituents might receive from such a\nnetwork.\n171"
