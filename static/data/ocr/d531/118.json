  "text": "might be classified as useable from an empirical point of view,\nperformance of each repeater station must be precisely optimized.\nAt this time the degree of optimization required is considered to\nbe wholly incompatible with the use of a reversing system and for\nthe purpose of obtaining transmission in either of two directions\nthroughout the system.\nActual operational experience in systems embodying fewer hops\nthan proposed herein, has shown that precise adjustment is required\nfor acceptable operation. No information can be obtained which\nwould permit a conclusion to be made that this level of adjustment\ncan be maintained where reversing apparatus is used. However, this\nconclusion does not preclude the possibility that newer and more\nsophisticated apparatus, which may become available in the foreseeÂ¬\nable future, will permit reversibility of circuits with great\nprecision and at reduced initial cost.\nMeanwhile, it is necessary that tentative design be based on\nrealizable factors. Accordingly, the two way circuits proposed for\nthe primary system in this study consist of independent sets of\napparatus for simultaneous operation in both directions throughout\nthe system.\nThere are numerous advantages to this method which tend to\noutweigh added cost. Some of these are:\n(A) High dependability of system due to the existence of\ntwo independent circuits feeding all principal points.\n(B) Availability of the second circuit for use in either\nclosed circuit transmission or diversity in network\nprogram scheduling.\n(C) Qoportunity for utmost optimization in all circuits\ncomprising the system."
