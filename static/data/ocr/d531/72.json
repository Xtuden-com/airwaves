For purposes\nof illustration, the total available audience has been tabulated\nin three main categories which have a logical interrelationship\nwith the three broad types of educational television programsi\n1) Population in the six-state region\n2) Public and non-public school enrollment in the region\n3) Enrollment in the region’s institutions of higher\nlearning\nThe table in Appendix 5 describes the totality of the six-\nstate proposed network in terms of numbers of persons in these\nthree categories who are in reliable range of the planned tele¬\nvision signals under both primary and secondary systems. Com¬\nputations are based on counties in each state which are totally\nwithin the coverage radii of the signals emanating from the\nvarious existing and proposed stations or transmitters, or where\nthe computed signal strength is sufficient to include a sig¬\nnificantly large proportion of the county.\nFor the convenience of officials in each of the six states,\nfurther detailed data is furnished for each state in Appendices\n6 through 11(a), describing the coverage on a county-by-county\nbasis in terms of total county population, total public and\nnon-public school enrollment through 12th grade, and names and\ntotal enrollment in institutions of higher learning located with¬\nin the areas of proposed coverage. Shown also are the propor¬\ntions of coverage of those audiences to the state total.\n66"
