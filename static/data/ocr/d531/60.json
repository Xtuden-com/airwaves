PROGRAM RESOURCES FROM THE CCMUNITY\nFor convenience, ” Pro gram Resources From the Community*1\nwill be used to mean the sources of program material and talent\nother than those found within colleges, universities and schools.\nAs indicated before, the use of this arbitrary category does not\nimply that there is a boundary between activities associated\nwith centers of learning and the communities within which they\nare located. A large portion of faculty members for instance,\nare active in civic, cultural and other community affairs, while\nmany facilities located on campuses are of general community\ninterest.\nBranches of national organizations whose activities and\ninformational services are of general community benefit are\nfound in hundreds of towns and cities in the six states and many\norganizations of purely local character have similar goals from\ncity to city.\nThese organizations include civic groups and clubs, service\nclubs, health and social services organizations, business and\nprofessional associations, etc. The following partial listing\nof such organizations, the majority of which have been involved\nin educational television presentations, is indicative of pro¬\ngram sources whose pooling of efforts on a regional basis could\noften result in far superior programs to those produced only\nby local memberships:\nThe League of Women Voters, Chamber of Commerce, Foreign\nPolicy Association, American Association of University Women,"
