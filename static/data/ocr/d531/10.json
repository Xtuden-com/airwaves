It could bring the best knowledge of agriculture available in\nsix great state colleges of agriculture to thousands who could profit\nfrom such instruction# It could bring music by great artists to the\nold and the heritage of our country, as explained by the great men and\nwomen among us, to the young# And only an educational television net¬\nwork can do all this at a price we can afford."
