Reportedly, short segments\nof picture material have been transmitted through \"low fidelity\"\ntrans-oceanic cable circuits with success. It is possible that this\nform of sophistication in the application of information theory may\neventually permit practical transmission of program material through\nordinary telephone quality circuits. It is too early to tell what\nthese developments will provide; however, they should be watched\nconcurrently with research on microwave networking so their full\npotential will not be missed.\nAnother form of bandwidth reduction has been demonstrated by\nan apparatus based on the digital encoding of television signals.\nTechnicolor Corporation has, for instance, experimental apparatus\nin operation permitting anywhere from a 2 to 1 to a 4 to 1 reduction\nin bandwidth based on these and other sophisticated principles.\n(See Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers Journal—Aug.\n1959).\n165"
