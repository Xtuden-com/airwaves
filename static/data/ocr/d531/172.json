  "text": "Research on television systems suitable for deep-Space probes\nis also spearheading the development of transmission systems which\ndrastically improve the factors of picture quality and reliability-\nversus-bandwidth and transmitting power requirements. (See Electronic\nNews--November 2, 1959—Page 5).\nMost any of these contemporary systems might enhance the\npossibilities for improved transmission of television through re¬\nstricted bandwidth cable circuits. On the other hand, considering\nthe vast forthcoming needs for television program interchange in\neducation, such an approach might be inadequate even for the immediate\nneeds.\nSince the methods used for compressing information into less\nbandwidth can be applied equally well to microwave transmission as\nwell as to the recording and broadcasting field, it might be well to\nlook upon these improvements as much needed reserves.\nIf, for instance, a microwave system such as that contemplated\nin this report were to be built to serve present needs, any equip¬\nment for bandwidth reduction could be considered as accessory items\nwhen and if such apparatus becomes available on the market. It\nwould appear therefore, that any revolutionary developments in in¬\nformation transmission might best be looked on as quality improvements\nand necessary resources for the future rather than as alternative to\ncurrent systems of microwave transmission and tape syndication.\nThese might multiply immensely the number of circuits available through\nan existing microwave facility, to say nothing of picture quality\nadvantages for both monochrome and color."
