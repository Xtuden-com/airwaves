State Networks and State Network Plans:\nA state network exists in Alabama. One was planned for\nOklahoma, though little has been accomplished on this.\nFlorida is actively planning a state network and Ohio has\nformulated an excellent state network plan. All of these\nhave some relevance to this study but, since all are con¬\nfined to one state, they are of only moderate value to\nthose planning an interstate network, with the many credit,\ncurriculum and other problems requiring solution when pro¬\ngrams are used across state lines. In programming, admin¬\nistration and policy formulation, no state netvrork can\nprovide guidance to a regional network on which many states\nmust agree and in which both public and private (non-profit)\ninstitutions are involved.\nb. Southern Regional Education Board Educational Television\nProposals\nThe Southern Regional Education Board has proposed, for\nactivation in the future, a regional network of some four¬\nteen southern states. Its proposals differ from the present"
