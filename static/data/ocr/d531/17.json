  "text": "ORGANIZATIONAL POSSIBILITIES\nFollowing these principles, several possibilities for organi¬\nzation were considered. First, a compact among the several states\nof the region which would be ratified by the state legislatures\nwas considered. A similar pattern was proposed in connection with\nthe projected Southern Regional Educational Board Educational Tele¬\nvision Project for a sixteBn-state network. This organizational\npossibility was rejected because, first, too many actual and poten¬\ntial Educational Television stations in this six-state region had\nno relationship to the state government: second, it was feared such\nan arrangement would take many years to effectuate and would be too\ncumbersome in operation. Finally, it was felt that such an organi¬\nzation would not be sufficiently responsive to the needs of non¬\ngovernmental educational organizations.\nA second way of effecting a network service would be in the\nnature of an informal agreement to exchange programs among the\nvarious participating stations. However practicable such an arrange¬\nment might be between two, or even three stations, it obviously would\nbreak down if the interests and needs of a dozen stations, three\ndozen production centers and several score communities were to be\nconsidered.\nIt therefore became apparent very early in the investigation of\nthis matter that a flexible plan, safeguarding local autonomy, but\nproviding the necessary unity for technical, financial, and circula¬\ntion purposes must be devised.\n11"
