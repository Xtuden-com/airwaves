  "text": "(D) Minimized need for supplementary apparatus to cover\ntelemetering, remote tuning, and voice communications\nthroughout the system.\n(E) Greater opportunity for the inclusion of supplementary\naudio transmission services to educational radio stations.\nThe microwave system has been designed so that any available\nfrequencies from 2000 me. up to 13,000 mcs. may be used.\nTechnical developments may change the cost shown. However,\nthe cost used in this study is the average cost for equipment beÂ¬\ning used by broadcasters in privately owned, multi-hop microwave\nsystems.\nThe microwave system cost figures include standby emergency\npower at the intermediate towers, provisions for automatic switch\nover to off-the-air pickup at each second tower of each leg in case\nof equipment failure in either of the first two hops of each leg.\nThe system includes terminal test equipment and three spare micro-\nwave units with cost being divided proportionally to each hop.\nTowers and all conceivable direct costs have been included in this\ncost study. All costs in this report are based on full list price\nwithout educational discount which is usually 10%, and no allowance\nfor large contract discount. Some of this potential discount can\nbe offset against cost of system installation and proof of performance\nprovided by the contractor.\n3.2 Information on the Map of the Microwave Network.\nThe microwave map shows the two-way primary network loop and\nbranch legs, and the single direction secondary service utilizing\noff-the-air pickups. The VHF station coverages are overlaid to show\nthe relationship between station coverage information and the microwave\nsites.\n113"
