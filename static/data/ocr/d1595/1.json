The more we slaved over words and became\nimmersed In specifics, the more it became evident that attempts to\nachieve such a legalistic document were futile - and probably\nunwise.\nThe position of the Executive Committee was presented to the Board\nat Columbus, by the Chairman of the TV Board, Loren Stone. I have\nasked him to let me include this statement in my column. It was the\nconsensus of the Board that the position stated above govern our\ngeneral position toward NETRC and that the cooperative working\nrelationships were to be worked out on a day-to*day, care-by-care\nbasis by the officers of the two agencies."
