Television industry in January took a step to¬\nward achieving standardization on a much-discussed, but still\ndevelopmental shallow TV picture tube when a committee of the\nRadio-Electronic-Television Manufacturers Association decided\nto omit from future consideration a projected 120-degree de¬\nflection tube. Instead, it was decided to concentrate on a\nproposed 110-degree deflection tube with a small tube neck.\nMost tubes being made today are 90-degree tubes. In the indus¬\ntry^ earlier days, 70-degree tubes were standard.\nIn Chicago, experimental work in teaching by television\nwas given another vote of approval when the public schools\nappropriated a $40,000 budget for 1956. Programs will go\nout over Chicago educational station WTTW, at special hours\nwith study programs, by top science and mathematics teachers,\nfor high school students.\n*****\nProminent Germans and Americans paid tribute to the U.S.\nInformation Service station RIAS — Radio in the American\nSector — on the occasion of its 10th anniversary, February 5.\nThe station, at which Dr. Harry J. Skornia, NAEB Executive\nDirector, was a consultant in 1948-1949; has proved a potent\nweapon for the West in broadcasting on eight frequencies to\nan audience estimated at several million.\n*****"
