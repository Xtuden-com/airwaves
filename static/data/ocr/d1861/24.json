By a contract with the Department of State, The\nSchool of Public Relations and Communications of Boston Univer¬\nsity is conducting an International Seminar on Radio and Tele¬\nvision.\nDuring the month of March, the grantees from Latin .America,\nBelgium, Germany, Iceland, Jordan, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and\nKorea studied in Boston. Now they are beginning a period of\napprenticeship in stations as widely scattered as Denver,\nEl Paso and Baltimore.\n*****\nIn answer to a request from Robert R. Richmond, Director\nof the Division of Information, U. S. Department of Labor,\nWage and Hour Public Contracts Division, we forwarded a list of\nmembers for use in their nation-wide educational and information\nprogram concerning child labor problems particularly. This\ninformation will help prevent unintentional violations, and will\nhelp explain the responsibilities and rights of employers,\nparents and children under the law.\nSince we can’t handle these centrally we felt it best to\nmake possible this direct approach, so that each station may\nmake its own decision on possible uses.\n*****\nThe National Project in Agricultural Communications has\npublished a new book. Creative Farm Shows. which is intended to\nbe of interest to educators, advertisers, agencies, public\nrelations specialists and other concerned with informational\ntelevision. Copies are available from NPAC, Wells Hall, Michi¬\ngan State University, East Lansing, ?fi.chigan, at $3.00 each."
