He recommends ad¬\njustment of cameras to within one microampere reading on the meter\nfor best results.\n*****\nWe recently received a new and very complete catalog from the\nGates Radio Company of Quincy, Illinois. It contains their com¬\nplete line of radio and television broadcasting equipment. Many\nof our readers have received this catalog; if you have not, we*d\nsuggest that you write directly to Gates requesting a copy.\n*****\nGeorge Murphy, Chief Engineer of the Auburn Polytechnic\nInstitute TV studio has compiled a very complete report of the\nequipment, material and procedures they employ for making 2x2\nslides for use on a television film camera. We had in mind repro¬\nducing it in the Engineering Newsletter; however it consists of\neight single-spaced typewritten pages plus four pages of data and\ndrawings. If there are a number of requests for this information,\nwe shall be happy to duplicate it for you or to make arrangements\nfor George to supply it to you.\n*****\nWe also have plans for a mock camera, including complete\ndetails for its construction which were prepared by Robert Schlorff,\nChief Engineer at Wayne University. This camera can be constructed\nat a cost of $50.00 for materials and is nearly as effective for\ncertain initial training purposes as a $16,000 image orthicon\ncamera. Students learn all operating techniques and student direc¬\ntors can check the pictures each cameraman obtains as well as\nexperiment in shot plotting.\nPlans for this camera are available, and further information\nmay be obtained from George Steiner, Supervisor of Undergraduate\nInstruction, Department of Speech, Wayne University, Detroit 1,\nMichigan.\n*****"
