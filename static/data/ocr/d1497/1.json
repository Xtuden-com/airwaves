S 5201 *ioh will have\nconsiderable affect upon educational broadcasting stations Special fees\nhave been charged for educational stations which are considerably less\nthan those of commercial stations, but they still represent substantial\nfigures.\nFor instance, each educational station Wider the Bill will pay¥5 as a\nfiling fee for each license renewal, licenses being for six.months. This\nwould be 410 a year. Each educational station will be required to pay\nTLual inspection fee of 415^he annual\ndetermined by powers and hours Operation. Station K0*C at Oregon\nState College under the Bill would pay an annual license fee of *300.\nStations wof, Iowa State Colleges and WHIP.
