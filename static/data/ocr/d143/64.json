  "text": "Such material will not only be needed in the television pro¬\nduction center for direct instruction, but will be needed in\nthe classrooms for follow-up and reinforcement activities.\nMuch of this material can be produced in the television in¬\nstruct ion--production center. But each of the high schools will\nbe provided limited facilities for producing and reproducing as\nmuch specific reinforcement material as possible. It will be the\nresponsibility of the instructional supervisors in each of the\nhigh schools to instruct the Samoan classroom teachers and to\nassist them in producing such material. In the production of\nany instructional material there will be a coordination of effort\nbetween the television instruction-production center and the\nlibrary-material center of each of the high schools.\nIn the follow-up reinforcement activities in the regular tele¬\nvision classes of the high schools as well as in any small or\nspecial instruction classes, the use of audio-visual materials\nwill be emphasized. Each school will be provided with an ade¬\nquate number of 16 mm. projectors, slide and film-strip pro¬\njectors, and overhead projectors. Each school library-materials\ncenter will have an adequate number of models--charts, and other\nmaterials subject to recurring use in the various subject areas\nfor the use of specified and structured reinforcement activities.\n14"
