  "text": "When each lesson of each course of study is planned for the tele¬\nvision presentation, there will be a concomitant planning of drill,\ninvestigation, self-study, and other reinforcement activities in\nthe classroom and outside the classroom following the television\nlesson. This, of course, strongly suggests that each class in each\nsubject area in all the schools will be doing the same thing at\nthe same time in their non-television activities. As far as general\ndirections go, this is true; but the extent of initiative, creativity,\norganization and energy that goes into the development of the reinforce¬\nment activities in the classroom is the range of latitude between what\nhappens in one school or in one class and another.\nThe structuring of the basic course of study and the uniform quality\nof instructional presentation on television enhances the potential\nof equal learning opportunities for all the children in American\nSamoa, but it does not stifle nor inhibit in any way creative activi¬\nties designed to reinforce learnings and to enable the Samoan child\nto relate his learned concepts and ideas to his own needs, aspirations,\nand environment.\nIt will not be easy for some who have been trained in traditional\nmethods to recognize the value of the classroom activities' being\nbasically structured and designed to reinforce the prime instructional\nexperience coming from television. Nevertheless, it is important and\nnecessary to the success of the new instructional program that all\neducational personnel completely and whole-heartedly involve them-\n7"
