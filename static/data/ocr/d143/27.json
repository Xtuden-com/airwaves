Rider\nJanuary *?, 1963\nHaven*t forgotten about the plastic cigar holders, and will get them to you\n(through ’‘mail room” to avoid customs, I suspect) just as soon as I can find\nsame. And I still owe you money - $11.60 to be exact - you'll recall that I\nsent you a check to pay you the balance at that time and you sent it back,\nalong with more money - so don't hesitate to holler for things you want.\nHop* that Jo's bout *Mh appendicitis turned out okay - I can imagine how con¬\ncerned you were, ej^pecially with the poor communications. The Hills are all\ndoing well - I presume you received our Christmas letter which gave most of the\ndetails. Sandy came out for a week for Christmas, then, Dorothy, Butch, Khthy,\nand I went up to NYC for a four-day weekend over Sew Year's. I don't really\nknow how things are going with Butch and Blnny. I know there was a brief period\nsome months ago when he didn't write her, and then he became pretty regular\nagain - but, now I gather, she doesn't write to him at all. He sent her a vexy\nnice ring for Christmas. If she happens to say anything about it in a letter to\nyou, you might let me know next time you write so that Butch will know it got\nthere okay.\nDo I gather that you are now carrying on your project under the Education\nDivision? You didn't say as much, but you Indicated your project had been trans¬\nferred and I presumed you went with it - or what?\nOur love to all the family - and if you hear of anything more on what they're\ngoing to do on the Nigerian project (especially if you can find out what they\nthink of our proposal), please let me know — I'll do the same.\nAs ever.\nHarold E. Sill\nVice President\nBEHsatb"
