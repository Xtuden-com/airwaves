  "text": "- 24 -\nthe photographic department ought to be employed in making 30 second and 60\nsecond and 120 second film clips to demonstrate and illustrate actions and\nsituations that cannot be produced live. When such clips are made they should\nbe catalogued and annotated and cross filed. If it is impossible to have either\nlive demonstrations or moving pictures, the third acceptable visual material\nwill be still photographs, that are properly made, in terms of subject content,\ncontrast, and sharpness of detail. Art work ought to be used only at such\ntimes as it serves a particular purpose that can be served in no other way,\nand never in lieu of a motion picture or a still photograph.\nIt is important that no useless or avoidable work be done to take up the ener¬\ngies of the instructional staff. To this end it is the policy that all lesson\nplans given to the teachers be in outline form and as brief, succinct and de¬\nscriptive as possible. Where it is at all practical, no lesson plan should\nexceed one sheet of paper. Where it is possible, student worksheets should\nbe prepared at the schools. Where it is not possible they should be prepared\nat the center with due consideration for the economy of effort and materials."
