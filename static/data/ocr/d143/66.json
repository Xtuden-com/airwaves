Thanks.\nMarch 11, 1965\nMr. Monroe Blackwell\nAccounting and Disbursing Officer\nGovernment of American Samoa\nPago Pago, American Samoa 96920\nDear Mr. Blackwell:\nDeference is made to a letter to you dated March 2 from\nMr. J. Parker Bailey, our accountant.\nIn order to be fiscally accurate, Mr. Bailey advised you of\nthe fact that we had erroneously omitted a portion of one of\nMr. Vernon Bronson** travel vouchers, and under your interpre¬\ntation of the situation, further adjustment should perhaps\nbe made.\nUnder the circumstances we felt obligated to call this to\nyour attention since you fslt that certain per diem should be\ndisallowed. However, X must strongly protest your disallowance\nof this item because it is my understanding from Mr. Bronson\nand Mr. William Kessler that they were not provided with\nhousing and meals in lieu of per diem. Therefore, X have\nasked Mr. Bronson and Mr. Kessler to provide me with a certified\nstatement setting forth the facts of the case. When X have\nreceived these, X will forward them to you with a bill for\nreimbursement•\nIn view of the excellent fiscal relationship we have always\nhad with your office, X am sure the matter can be worked out\nto everyone's satisfaction once we provide you with supporting\ndata. Meanwhile, I Just wasted to let you know that, even\nthough Mr. Bailey correctly Informed you that not enough had\nbeen deducted according to your interpretation, we are protesting\nthe disallowance and will provide you with another bill at the\nproper time.\nSincerely,\nHarold £. Hill\nHEB/mlm\ncc: Vernon Bronson\nWilliam Kessler\nvice: Ta*Ucfi-"
