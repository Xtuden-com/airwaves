To raise the achieve¬\nment level of the children.\nThese are the simple broad objectives, but it is clear that to achieve these\nbroad objectives there must be established and underscored a complex of sub¬\nobjectives. Among this supporting complex of objectives are the following:\n1. To improve the technical and subject matter competency of\nthe native Samoan teachers.\n2. To prepare the great bulk of Samoan children to live and\nwork and make a better life for themselves in Samoa.\n3. To offer equality of educational opportunity to all of the\nchildren in all of the villages in all of the islands of\nAmerican Samoa.\n4. To increase competency in the use of the English language\nto the point where language is no barrier to educational\ndevelopment.\n5. To raise the level of learning opportunities to the point\nwhere those Samoan children who desire to go beyond high\nschool may provide themselves with a sound educational\nbase that will enable them to enter American colleges and\nuniversities and compete on an equal level with other\nAmerican students.\n6. To develop such manual skills and functional arts that will\ncontribute to a better economic and social structure.\n7.
