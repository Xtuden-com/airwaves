University Drive\nGainesville, Florida\nDear Bill:\nI hadn't answered your letter of April 4, because X had\nanticipated seeing you at the Region XX meeting in Columbia.\nI understand there were sudden conflicts which prevented your\nattendance - sorry that we didn't get to see you.\nYou are correct in assuming that the transportation and per\ndiem of the assistant you take along to Samoa are to be\ncovered outside of your fee — in other words, we are respon¬\nsible for such expenses.\nThe matter of the signature should present no problems at all,\nso we won't worry about it.\nWe will be processing for payment the statement for $6000 before\nthe end of the month, bgt we may hold up the actual mailing of\nthe check until a little later. I presume that Vernon discussed\nthis with you and that this is all right with you.\nRegards,\nHarold X. Hill\nHSH/mlm\ncc: Mr. Vernon Bronson"
