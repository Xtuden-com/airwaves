  "text": "In the instructional television system, any device for testing\nthe students must be, as in all the rest of the process, a co¬\noperative effort among all of the instructional personnel in¬\nvolved. Such a device may consist of required activities pro¬\nducing required results and supervised by classroom teachers; it\ncould be study or research assignments given by the television\nteacher and written results cross-graded in the classroom; or it\nmay be a quiz-type of procedure with questions asked and answers\nchecked by teachers or students. Whatever the device, it must\nbe something that will apply to the particular situation exist¬\ning in this system at this time and understood by both teachers\nand students. In any event, there must be one guiding principle\nin developing tests and measurements for a secondary television\nschool system--whatever is done must be as much of a teaching\ndevice, as a learning reinforcement device, as it is a testing\ndevice.\nINSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS\nIt will be possible for the secondary television schools to use\na great deal of commercially-produced material and some textbooks\nfrom the United States. In spite of this, there are certain areas\nwhere really effective materials will have to be produced in Samoa\nand oriented to the particular instructional needs of the Samoan\nstudents.\n13"
