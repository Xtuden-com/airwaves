  "text": "TRANSITION\nUniversal secondary education in American Samoa will be beginning its\nfourth year in the school term of the years 1965-66. In order to pro¬\nvide adequate plant facilities for the increasing high school population,\nand to distribute such facilities among the population centers of\nAmerican Samoa, new high school buildings are being constructed at Leone\nand Manua, and the high school plant at Utulei will be modified and\nadapted to the changing program.\nDuring this period the entire secondary program will be involved in the\nchange-over from the traditional classroom system to the cooperative\nsystem of instruction by television. The instructional television\nsystem is designed to provide equal learning opportunities in all the\nsecondary grades in all the high schools in American Samoa. It is also\ndesigned to make possible a gradual build-up of Samoan instructional\npersonnel and administrative staff. During the period of change-over,\nit is possible that there will be some confusion and some disadvantages\nencountered, because the change-over will not only entail a reorganiza¬\ntion of class schedules, a transition from small classes to large classes,\nand a new approach to study and other reinforcement activities, but also\nthe opening and staffing of two new high school organizations. However,\nmuch of the possible confusion during this period will be eliminated if\nthe entire staff and faculty of the secondary education department have\nan adequate understanding of the nature of the change-over, the methods\nthat will be used, the goals to be achieved, and are mutually helpful in\nachieving such goals."
