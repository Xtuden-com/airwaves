  "text": "The last major element in this faculty and staff change is the\nCurriculum Development Committee. More will be said about the\ncurriculum later; but the make-up of the curriculum committee must\nnecessarily include the supervisor of television instruction, the\nclassroom instructional supervisors, the Principals of the schools,\nand the Director of the Department of Education as ex officio chair¬\nman. This committee must be a permanent and continuing committee\nand must be concerned with the responsibilities that will be\nenumerated under the reference to curriculum.\n3. METHODS\nThe third basic change after structure, staff and faculty is in\nthe general methodology of instruction. Heretofore, in the secondary\nschools of American Samoa, instruction generally has been the re¬\nsponsibility of a single subject-matter teacher in a more-or-less\nself-contained classroom. In the new system of cooperative in¬\nstruction by television, the core of the instruction will be by tele¬\nvision. The development of the scope and sequence and depth of each\ncourse of study will be the result of a cooperative effort on the\npart of a group of qualified persons and will be subject to continuing\nconstructive criticism and modification. The activities of the class¬\nroom conducted by the Samoan teachers under the supervision of the\nclassroom instructional supervisors will be designed to amplify, re¬\nlate, and reinforce ideas and understandings developed through the\ntelevision lessons.\n6"
