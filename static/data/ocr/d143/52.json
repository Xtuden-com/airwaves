  "text": "To effect the application of television instruction to the secondary\nschools, it will be necessary to make some basic changes in the organiza¬\ntion of courses and in the general scheduling of classes. Each of the\nthree high schools will operate on approximately the same class schedules,\nand all students taking the same subject at the same grade level and/or\nthe same achievement level will be scheduled at the same hour and will\nreceive all basic informational and conceptual instruction by television.\nThe new buildings at Leone and Manua have been designed to facilitate the\nnew class structure. The buildings at Utulei will be modified and ex¬\ntended to accommodate the new patterns of organization.\nBASIC CHANGES\n1. STRUCTURE\nThere are three basic changes that will affect the secondary school\nsystem in American Samoa in the introduction of the new system of\ninstruction. The first is structural in nature. The structure of\nthe classrooms will be different. They are designed first and fore¬\nmost to accommodate large class groups that can be supervised, di¬\nrected, and motivated by a single teacher. They are also planned to\nhave maximum flexibility so that they can accommodate areas for\nindividual study, and small special and remedial classes without\nimpairing the efficiency of the instruction in the large central\ngroup. The basic structure of the new system will also be changed\nby the inclusion of the television receiver and the television\nstudio as an integral part of its function.\n2"
