We have combed the radio field\nto secure as many outstanding educational scripts and recordings as\npossible. Wherever possible, permission has been secured for a\nnumber of these to be used locally. It is our belief that education\nthrough this medium should not only be beneficial but entertaining\nas well. Additional quantities of the listed scripts and recordings\nare available.\nRADIO SCRIPTS\nThe scripts listed may be produced effectively at educational\nmeetings by a variety of organizations, including interfaith, religious,\ngood will, literary, youth, school, dramatic, labor and veteran groups.\nThey can be secured from the organizations named in connection with\nthe respective scripts. Some of the scripts are easily produced; others\nrequire large casts and more elaborate production. They can all be\neffective. Whenever used, proper credit must be given to the original\nsponsor of the broadcast, the local station or network on which it\nappeared, as well as the author of the script. Unless otherwise indiÂ¬\ncated, these scripts may be rebroadcast on member stations of the\nnetwork on which the broadcast was originally presented. Some of the\nscripts, if so specified in the description, may be rebroadcast on\nany independent local station. They are not to be performed for profit\nor under commercial sponsorship."
