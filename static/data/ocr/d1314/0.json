OCTOBER, 1966\nCOMSAT'S SATELLITE PLAN\nThe Communications Satellite Corpora¬\ntion, authorized in 1962 by Congress as a\ncommercial organization to run a world¬\nwide communications satellite system, has\nsuggested this alternative to the Ford\nFoundation proposal for financing ETV:\nComsat would tax users of space circuits,\nturn revenues over to a designated agency\nfor disbursement to ETV.\nComsat president Dr. Joseph V. Charyk\nsaid that satellite users will benefit in sav¬\nings resulting from eliminating conventional\nfacilities such as land lines, cables, etc.\nETV could operate on a reduced rate, per¬\nhaps free, if permitted by law and the\nFCC.\nDr. Charyk offered no estimate on how\nmuch money might be raised, indicated that\nit would be more than the Ford figure.\nSince the Comsat idea is based on satellite\nusers relinquishing small percentages of\nsavings, the greater the saving, the bigger\nthe economic boost to ETV—all to come\nabout if large satellite users are permitted\nto deal directly with Comsat Charyk said.\nETV Trust Territory Study\nNAEB has been awarded a study grant\nby William Norwood, High Commissioner,\nTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands, to\nselect and direct a team which will survey\nthe Territory’s total education system and\nevaluate needs of both public and private\nschools.\nEarlier investigation showed that televi¬\nsion could serve 85% of the area’s chil¬\ndren. The Trust Territory encompasses a\ndistance greater than the continental U. S.,\nindicating that a variety of different trans¬\nmission systems will have to be established.\nNY ETV Politicasts\nNew York state Democratic and Repub¬\nlican convention activities were covered by\nWNDT Newark, WMHT Schenectady,\nWCNY Syracuse, WXXI Rochester,\nWNED Buffalo. WNDT’s Robert Potts\nand Mitchell Krauss were part of the six-\nman telecast team, which was headed by\nNew York’s deputy mayor Robert Price\nand Democratic political leader Edward\nCostikyan.\nThe FCC in Review\nRM-764: NAEB has opposed ABC’s pe¬\ntition which states that the FCC has al¬\nready properly evaluated the issue of ETV\nvs. commercial assignment of Channel 8,\nMetford, Oregon. The Commission has re¬\njected request for reservation from the State\nof Oregon, acting through the Board of\nHigher Education. ABC is likely to get its\nthird outlet in the community—population\nunder 25,000.\nNAEB argued that Metford is not a\nlarge enough market to warrant a third\nprime channel broadcasting commercial fare\nwhen an educational applicant is ready,\nwilling and able to operate ETV immedi¬\nately. Furthermore, closer scrutiny of who\ngets VHF is vital, instead of automatic\nevaluation by a standard formula that\nkeeps relegating ETV to UHF bands.\nEconomic disadvantages are more acute\nfrom the educator’s standpoint, have\nprompted federal enactments such as the\nETV Facilities Act and provide the basic\npremise for the recent Ford Foundation\nplan for domestic satellites.\nRM-881: Symphony Network Associa¬\ntion, Inc. has requested reservation for a\n3-year period of 94 FM assignments in 41\nStates in the educational FM band for a\nnational symphony network. NAEB wants\ntheir petition denied on these grounds: Ed¬\nucational FM channels are now in use at a\nhigher rate than ever by nonprofit educa¬\ntional groups. Studies of outstanding li¬\ncenses show that 20% of all educational ra¬\ndio stations have been licensed since 1962,\nreflecting accelerated growth—predicted to\nmove faster in the next few years. “The\npressures for wise and efficient use of\nspectrum space are mounting. These scarce\nfrequencies should not be diverted from\ntheir prime purpose—provision of compre¬\nhensive non-commercial educational FM\nservice, embracing all aspects of education,\ninstructive and informative programing and\ncultural and entertainment services. Multi¬\npurpose use is the key to educational use,”\nNAEB said.\nThe FOC named NAEB to the Advisory\nCommittee for Testing Sharing of Televi¬\nsion Channels by Land Mobile Radio Serv¬\nices. Charles Prohaska, director of oper¬\nations, WET A, Channel 26, Washington,\nD. C., will serve as individual representa¬\ntive for the Association.\nIMD Election Procedures\nIndividual members in Regions III and\nVI will elect directors this fall to serve\nthree-year terms on the NAEB Board. Un¬\nder terms of NAEB By-Laws, incumbents\nIMD Board chairman Robert Suchy, Re¬\ngion III and John Crabbe, Region IV may\nnot succeed themselves.\nAfter consultation with Suchy, Crabbe,\nand Harold Hill, NAEB vice president and\nIMD executive director, NAEB president\nWilliam Harley named the following nom¬\ninating committees:\nREGION III:\nRobert Suchy, chairman—director, ETV\ndepartment, Milwaukee public schools,\n5252 West Vliet St., Milwaukee, Wis¬\nconsin.\nWalter Emery, Michigan State Univer¬\nsity professor of radio and television,\nMass Communications Center, E.
