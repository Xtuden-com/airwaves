THERE'LL BE TIME BETWEEN AFTERNOON SESSION AND THE\nEVENING BANQUET. YOU*LL ENJOY THE SETTING, TOO.\nMaybe I ought to have a guest editor on this page, but since this will\nBE THE LAST, IT'S A BIT LATE FOR THE IOEA j DON* T YOU THINK. I FEEL\nTHIS WAY NOW BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF TIME. I'VE JUST COME OUT OF>\nAN HOUR**AND-A-HALF TV PROGRAM BOARD MEETING. AND BEFORE THAT THERE\nWAS THE WORLD SERIES ON TV. AND BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A CLASS TO\nTEACH. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL FALL DUTIES, I'M NOW BACK TEACHING BE¬\nCAUSE WE HAD SUCH A LARGE ENROLLMENT THAT POOR ScHOOLEY IS NOW TEACH¬\nING A CLASS HE HASN'T TAUGHT FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS.\nSuppose some of you noted the reference to the NAEB TV studies in\nNew York in a recent issue of the US News and World Report. The issue\nCARRIED A NUMBER OF ARTICLES ON WHAT TV jS DOING TO AMERICA. REFER¬\nENCE TABLE WAS BASED ON NAEB STUDIES AND FINDINGS.\nUnderstand that John Schwarzwalder is in Europe for a short stint.\nDon't know details, but he was gone from Houston when I tried To talk\nwith him one day recently. Talked with Siegel, too, day before he\nleft for Perugia to attend Prix Italia doings. NAEB entry won a\nprize, too. That's all to Si's credit and efforts.\nI HOPE YOU NOTED IN SPECIAL MAILING OF LAST WEEK, THAT 1956 AND 1957\nCONVENTION SITES WILL BE PICKED AT OUR CHICAGO CONVENTION. WHILE THE\nCOMMITTEE IS PRETTY WELL ALONG IN FINDINGS FOR 1956* IT MAY STILL NOT\nBE TOO LATE. AND 1957 15 WIDE OPEN. If YOU WANT TO PLAY HOST, BETTER\nGET WORD TO BURTON PAULU, PRONTO .\nPerhaps I'm short a few dozen lines in filling two pages this month,\nBUT THINK OF THE TIME I ' LL BE SAVING YOU, SO WILL CLOSE WITH A WISH\nAND HOPE THAT l*LL SEE YOU IN.CHICAGO.\n-—Frank Schooley"
