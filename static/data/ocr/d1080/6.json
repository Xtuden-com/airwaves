  "text": "and cooperating with the national board, a series of regional boards, these\nregional boards to attend to questions of regional importance and value; under\nthe regional boards, state boards, one in each state in the Union.\nYou see at once here is a hierarchy of probably fifty-five boards getting\ntheir information, maintaining their contacts with the people, and directing in a\ngeneral way the policies and operation of a government system. Under such general\nboards there will be the operating and technical officials.\nNow, can America, frankly, depend with assurance upon the integrity and\nability and the public good will of such boards? We have suggested a method whereby\nwe think they might be selected from known leaders in public welfare, representa¬\ntives of education, of religion, of labor, of medicine, of law, of public welfare\nof any character. We have suggested that they be selected from those leaders,\nnonpartisan, nonpolitical, in character; that they be given terms with staggered\ndates of beginning and ending so that it would take a series of years for any party\nor parties to capture control of these fifty or sixty boards.\nYou think of such boards, composed of such leaders with their staggered terms\nand continuity as this system gives, you think of them as being of every political\nfaith, chosen without regard to that, and I think you must agree with me that the\ncapture of such a system by anybody would be exceedingly difficult.\nWe have therefore, we believe, maintained this element of freedom and diversi¬\nfication which we claim is essential to the successful use of any national broad¬\ncasting system.\nAmerica has achieved reliability and trustworthiness in many of her public\nofficials. I wish to mention to you as an example the public schools which spend\nmillions of dollars annually. How many cases do you remember of public school\nofficials being accused of malfeasance in office or improper use of power, or\npartisanship being dragged into the public school systems? We have succeeded\nin that case in electing American citizens—government officials if you please—\n-7-"
