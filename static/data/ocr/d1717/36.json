In the first place*\n' it is oriented towards areals specific problems namely* how station KXXX’s broadcast\npolicy is related to the educational policy of the Blankville School System* or the\nUniversity of Transylvania® In this context* the organizational* budgetary* person¬\nnel* physical plant* and educational policy aspects of the institution all come into\nfocus* with plenty of room left over for bringing to bear general and comparative\neducational theory* human relations* and semantics too® In the second place* the case\nstudy approach is useful because it permits consideration to be given to the unique\naspects of the institution’s environment® If our hypothetical institution is in the\nSouth* this means that the case study will consider the social and economic facts in.\nthe institution’s \"constituency\" which condition the formulation of its grand design®\nThe racinl composition of the population* the economic and political structure of the\narea*, arri the like* are facts which must be evaluated in planning an educational policy\nfor the institution and its broadcast arm® If our hypothetical institution is in a\nNorthern mining area* the colors selected to depict the environmental pattern will be\ndifferent (because the relevant social* economic* and political facts will be different)\nbut the basic palette of analytical concepts applied to the environment will be the same\nIn the third place* the case study approach is good because it, permits a valid basis\nto be laid for considering the educational policy of the station and ihe institution\nagainst this environmental backdrop® Unless this relativistic approach is used* it is\ndifficult to imagine a realistic weighing of policy alternatives in the light of the\nvalue scales* mores and cultural goals to which such alternatives are relevant® Put\ninto plain language* what this means is that when one considers whether Southern\nUniversity X should or should not be asked to support a given educational broadcast\npolicy on such and such a social problem* one can only weigh the decision practically\nin terms of knowledge of how the various segments of the area’s population will respond\nto the broadcasts® This response is conditioned by the kinds of factors listed above®\nIn this context the educational theory* the educational philosophy* and the knowledge\nof the structure of the educational system of the country as a whole will be meanings\nfully related to the real situation of the case studies®\nWhatever the individual’s view of the foregoing argument may be it will probably be\nconceded that the relation of research and policy is closer in educational than in any\nother kind of institution® And this is true of the broadcast side as well as other\naspects of the institution’s activity® Clear and hopeful recognition of these consid¬\nerations is observable in encouraging ways® The program under the Kellogg grant is\ncommitted to studies of the relation of the broadcasting function to the institution\nand its community environment (though these have not yet been started)© And we (speak¬\ning personally) are happy that one of the NAEB’s outstanding members (and officers)\nis considering the doing for his doctoral dissertation of an evaluation of the \"grand\ndesign\" of an institution and station®"
