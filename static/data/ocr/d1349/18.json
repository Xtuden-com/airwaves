  "text": "THE SOCIAL ROLE OF THE EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION STATION\nVI\nSumming up the conception of the social role of educational television that has been\noutlined here, we may emphasize the importance of comprehending the scope of the\noperation in terms of the entire social process. We are concerned with communication,\nand the basic functions of communication have been formulated in terms of surveillance,\ncorrelation and pedagogy. We have examined the act of educational communication\nthrough the mass media in reference to a specialized list of questions;: Who says what to\nwhom in what medium to what audience with what effect? And we have put the act of\ncommunication in the fundamental framework of the social process^ man pursuing values\nthrough institutions using resources. Of the value-institution processes, enlightenment\nand skill are the two in which educational communicators are most intimately involved.\nIf the flow of public decisions and private choices in any given community are to be made\nmore rational in terms of the basic goals of the society, the stream of communication\nmust perform several vital functions. In particular, it is essential that the members of\nthe community come to possess images of the goals, trends, conditions, projections and\nalternatives which they have in common.\nIt is not the province of educational television to take over all the operations\nconcerned with public enlightenment. But it is within the scope of those in charge of this\nnew instrument to plug the gaps among existing agencies, to invent new model-ways of\ndoing things, and to evolve a professional overview of the community process as a whole.\n- 16 -"
