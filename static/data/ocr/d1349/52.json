  "text": "TELEVISION AND ADULT EDUCATION\ndiscover the real needs of real people and secure the maximum grass roots help in meet¬\ning those needs. This is an extremely important point of view for effective adult education\nSecond, educational television must work with program resources of all kinds wher¬\never they can be found — universities and colleges, other schools, the professions, busi¬\nness and labor groups, and community organizations. These are your resources for\neffective adult education programs. No adult education agency, no matter how great it maj\nbe, can possibly staff itself adequately if it has a large and varied clientele, which tele¬\nvision is certain to have. Such an organization must reach out to tap all kinds of resources\nEven a large university like our own, with all kinds of technical resources on its own\ncampus, cannot begin to meet the staff needs of a diversified extension program. If this is\ntrue of university extension at the present time, it will be even more true of television as\nit reaches out to fill many of these needs of adults. I would urge that educational tele¬\nvision search for those relationships in the universities and in community groups that\nwill afford them the richest possible resources for programming. Eventually your pro- I\ngrams will probably touch all adults with all their interests, and if that is true, your\nefforts will tend to become literally as broad as life itself.\n- 50 -"
