We’d like to\nserve you.\nThe good station staff does not just organize a committee because it is a nice thing\nto do. Your product will be more functional, and you will create an attitude where\nthere will be a probable increase in the use of your programs. Use teachers to do the\nthings they can do in many services such as evaluation and research.\nWhen the video tape recorder is available, classroom telecasts will be tested\nfirst in the classroom before broadcast. Why take up the time of thousands of pupils\nwith a questionable effort? Go into the classroom and gauge their interests that way.\nMake sure there is a pretty good relationship between an interest factor and a content\nfactor. The teachers will be long on content. The children will be long on interest.\nSee if you can reconcile the two. If you are going to be scientific about this, children\nwill be brought into the evaluation constantly, at their own level.\nIntegrational procedures need not await independent station operation. By using\ncommercial facilities first you find out who your talent is within the system, and you\nmake your teachers aware of the potential of television. Second, your own studio, and\nthird, your own station. It seems to me in terms of program development, it is public\nrelations, adult education, out of school viewing, and finally in-classroom broadcasting.\nThat is the metamorphosis of school telecasting, never, of course, assuming that the\nfourth step eliminates the first. But things being what they are, a ready-made audience,\na ready-made transmitter, someone else’s knowhow—begin with that and lead into the\nother.\n- 61 -"
