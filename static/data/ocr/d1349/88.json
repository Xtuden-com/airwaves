  "text": "COMMITTEE REPORTS\nbe given the new graduate who frequently finds the transition into adult life an abrupt one,\nand to the young person who cannot attend school. The resources of the educational tele¬\nvision station should be made available to all these groups at times convenient to them.\nWith pre-school and home-bound children, parents also are closely involved.\n1. The Pre-School Child. The very young child should be aided in\nacquiring worthwhile behavior attitudes, and his parents instructed in child\ndevelopment and in establishing good child-parent-teacher relationships.\nWholesome entertainment for the pre-school child is in itself a worthwhile\npurpose.\n2 The Post-School Child. Television promises to be the most important\nlink between the school dnd the recent graduate or ’’drop-out.\" Vocational and\navocational guidance services are needed. Programs indicating the responsi¬\nbilities as well as the rights of young citizens are particularly important.\n3 The Home-Bound Child. There also is the challenge to aid young\npeople who for various reasons cannot attend school and must remain at home.\nThey need a bond with their own age group. They should be made to feel that\nothers are interested in their problems. Regardless of their geographical\nlocations or home conditions, these home-bound pupils can receive better\ninstruction in a wider range of subjects from television than from any other\nmedium.\n- 86 -"
