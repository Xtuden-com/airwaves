  "text": "TELEVISION AND OTHER MEDIA\nquestions can give us feedback, the kind of thing Plato criticized books for-lack of reader\nreaction.\nWhere are all our programs coming from? Initially we shall get many of them from\nthe Educational Television and Radio Center. With a heavy load of broadcasting much of\nour material will have to be on film. I hope that the NAEB and similar organizations will\nsee these films as material to be studied, to be evaluated, as patterns worthy of thought¬\nful imitation. But I would put great emphasis on developing local teachers—persons who\ncould get lots of ideas by looking at kinescopes-and then develop their own live programs.\nI have a hunch that a new definition of extension teaching is in the making. We can\ndemonstrate superbly well with television. Why not use our home demonstration people\nthere rather than in the field? It is hard to take along the necessary equipment for demon-\nstration in the field. Why not televise it?\nWith artful charts and drawings, sound films, panels and the like we can present a\ntopic like world trade in a way now impossible in the typical college class. If we want to\nextend important concepts in political science, sociology, marketing to the farthest\nborders of our state, isn’t this the way to do it?\n- 38 -"
