The following generalizations are commonly\naccepted concerning the use of television in schools:\n1. Television is a new power tool for education: timeliness, immediacy\nand realism are the features which make it a highly important medium for broad-\ncasting to schools.\n2. School telecasting must be based on the psychological principles which\ngovern all learning.\n3. School telecasting must strive to disseminate information, develop\nskills, inculcate desirable attitudes and increase understanding.\n4. Television should provide pupils with additional learning experiences\nand help the teacher do a better job. It need not compete with existing teach¬\ning materials or techniques; television has its own unique advantages.\n5. In-school telecasts should be keyed to the curriculum and be directed\nto specific age and achievement levels.\n6. The results obtained from school telecasting should be constantly\nappraised through the use of the best research techniques.\nThe complexity of school schedules, particularly at the secondary level, presents\na problem for in-school telecasting just as it did for radio. In places where in-school\ntelecasts have been used, this has been met largely through coordinated planning by both\nbroadcasters and school people. Repeat telecasts, both live and recorded, are one\nsolution.\nTeachers should participate in the planning of all school telecasts, although pro¬\ngram production should remain the responsibility of the television staff. While\ntechnical finish is a desirable factor in any broadcast, it is npt so important as well\nchosen content or sound educational presentation.\n- 84 -"
