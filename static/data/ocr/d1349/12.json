How do we want to play our part in this process?\nPerhaps we can make the question clearer if we use a brief outline of the social\nprocess. Let us speak of it as:\nMan\nSeeking Values\nThrough Institutions\nUsing Resources.\nThe \"values” are the categories of preferred events, the chief gratifications that people\nwant. The \"institutions” are the patterns by which values are shaped and shared.\nIt is not important that all should use the same list of values to describe society.\nBut we need such a list for purposes of communication. So I propose to introduce such\na list, wholly for the sake of convenience, and not as a recommendation that you adopt\nthe identical list.\nWell-being is a value. It means health, safety and comfort. The institutions of a\ncommunity specialized to well-being include organized agencies like hospitals, and un¬\norganized patterns of action like popular health habits.\nWealth is a value. We refer to goods and services (or claims to goods and\nservices). All the mines, farms, factories, warehouses, retail shops, offices, and the\nlike belong among the economic institutions. Wealth also includes the standard of\nliving.\nA third value in our list is skill (and taste). People are interested in maturing\ntalent into skill, whether it is a question of manual dexterity, bodily strength, intellec¬\ntual ability, musical creativeness, or aesthetic judgment.\nRespect is a social value. People give or withhold deference from one another,\nwith the result that the community can be described according to upper, middle and\nlower social class structure. A social class is not a caste. (We have caste when\nindividuals cannot change position.)\nEnlightenment is a value, the one with which we are most immediately implicated\nin educational radio and television. Enlightenment refers to the stream of information\n- 10 -"
