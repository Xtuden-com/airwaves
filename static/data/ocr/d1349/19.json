  "text": "THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\nDonald Horton\nAssistant Professor of Sociology\nUniversity of Chicago\nI will spend most of my time reporting on the work of the University of Chicago’s\nCommittee on Educational Television. * But first let me make a few comments on my\nannounced topic—the role of research. It seems to me that defining the role of the edu¬\ncational television station is not a research problem. This is a problem of social\naction, and its solution can only be determined on the basis of social and educational\npolicy and values. All of you involved in it share with the institutions building and\nsupporting television stations responsibility for determining what educational television\nshall do, and in what direction it will go.\nI\nResearch can help in a number of ways. It can’t help in defining the objective,\nbut it can, when the time comes, do a great deal by way of measuring your achievement.\nI hope that, as educational television develops, a good deal of experimentation with the\nassessment of its efficiency and success will be undertaken.\nAnother type of research of some value to you might be called operational re¬\nsearch. I have in mind studies of the operation of a television station, and comparisons\nof different ways of operating a station and of integrating it with the community or school\n^University of Chicago’Committee on Educational Television, T elevision jndthe\nUniversity.
