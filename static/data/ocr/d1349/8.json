We send special¬\nized observers abroad in the shape of diplomatic attaches, foreign correspondents,\nespionage agents, and the like. To perform the correlation function we have an intricate\nnetwork of mass and specialized media, and many circuits of a two-way kind. And of\ncourse the institutions devoted to pedagogy are prominent in every culture.\nAppraise the local community in this frame of reference. Members of the\ncommunity may be away at different seasons of the year, sending back messages that\nrange from ’’Having wonderful time, wish you were here” to reports on what goes on at\nthe state capital or at Washington or in Moscow that has some significance for the life,\nliberty and pursuit of happiness of the whole. Radio and television stations contribute\nto the performance of the surveillance and the correlation functions. In addition, they\ntransmit skill. It is obvious that educational television has a fundamental place in the\nsocial process, and that the effectiveness with which this job is done can affect the\nquality of the decisions made by the community. This is true of every community in\nthe ever-enlarging circle from neighborhood to town to metropolis, and up to the region,\nthe nation and the international coalition.\nII\nHaving located educational television in this broad context, suppose we look at it\nin a more intensive frame of reference. The following questions are always pertinent\nin reference to any act or process of communications\nWho\nSays What\nTo Whom\nIn What Medium\nTo What Audience\nWith What Effect?\n- 6 -"
