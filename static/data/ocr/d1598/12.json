LaFond, Chief Engineer of\nWKNO-TV in Memphis. He was stricken with a\nheart attack and died at his home on December 21.\nHis untimely death at 43 was a shock to his family\nand associates.\nMr. LaFond was one of the first members of the\nstaff of WKNO-TV and designed the stations en¬\ngineering facilities. He engaged in every type of\nactivity as well as engineering to help activate Chan¬\nnel 10 in Memphis. He was formerly employed as an\nengineer at KUHT, the pioneer ETV station at the\nUniversity of Houston. He received his BA in Radio\nand Television at the University of Houston in 1951\nand his MA there in 1953.\nMr. LaFond is survived by his wife and a daugh¬\nter, Michelle.\n*****\nDid you see -\nSpecial Report on ETV Broadcasting Nov. I I\nFCC Mobile TV Monitor Broadcasting Dec. 2\nNew York State Seeks Channel 13 Broadcasting Dec. 9\nRCA has announced that it is developing new\ntype fm broadcast transmitters and complementary\nmultiplexing equipment. By late 1958, they expect\nto have a complete line of fm transmitters designed\nfor multiplex operation. The line will include the\nfollowing: a 10 w exciter-transmitter; a 250 w fm\ntransmitter; a 5kw fm transmitter, and multiplex\nsubcarrier generator equipment for use with RCA\nmultiplex exciters.\n*****\nThe FCC has authorized a TV translator station\nat Redwood Falls, Minn, to rebroadcast the pro¬\ngrams of KTCA-TV St. Paul’s educational TV sta¬\ntion.\n*****\nGeneral Electric has announced a new and smal¬\nler type of live color TV camera at the opening of\nits new WGY-WGRB (TV) broadcast center in\nSchenectady.\nThis new camera uses three image orthicon tubes\nbut weighs 75 pounds less than most models. It is\nabout ten inches shorter, three inches narrower and\nan inch lower than current cameras. Printed circuits\nand transistors have been used to cut down size. A\nnew optical system eliminates many glass surfaces\nand special circuitry, it is claimed, insures truer re¬\ngistration of colors with no blur or run over into\nother colors.\nA pre-production model was demonstrated, how¬\never GE expects to put the new camera into produc¬\ntion soon. The expected price is around $50,000 com¬\npetitive with other makes.\n*****\nFCC on December 18 proposed rule making un¬\nder Docket No. 12274 to permit daytime stations to\nget longer operating hours. The Daytime Broad¬\ncasters Association has proposed operation from 5\nAM or local sunrise (whichever is earlier) to 7 PM\nor local sunset (whichever is later) instead of pre¬\nsent sunrise-sunset only provisions. Comments on\nthis proposal are due March 18, reply comments 30\ndays later. For complete text see Federal Register,\nDec. 24, 1957.\n*****\nVorce C. McIntosh, Chief Engineer, University\nTV and Radio, The University of New Mexico at\nAlbuquerque, is looking for an RCA Type TC-4\nAudio-Video Switcher. If you have one for sale\nplease contact him.\n*****\nJust before deadline, we received a communica¬\ntion stating that WRTI-FM, Temple University in\nPhiladelphia, has installed a new 500 watt fm trans¬\nmitter. It is the first transmitter to be manufactured\nby a new firm, I.T.A., Industrial Transmitters and\nAntennas, 7327-A West Chester Pike, Upper Darby,\nPenna. Their new line of fm transmitters, designed\nespecially for the 88-108 me educational band, con¬\nsists of 10, 75, 250 and 500 watt transmitters. The\nlatter two transmitters have been type accepted by\nthe FCC and the 10 and 75 watt models are now\nbeing processed for approval.\nWith the number of fm stations on the air grow¬\ning daily, and with no more fm channels available in\nlarge population centers, educational institutions\nwould do well to take another look at fm broadcas¬\nting. Pressure is certain to develop for the FCC to\nassign the unused channels for commercial use, once\nthe available commercial assignments are occupied.\nFor years Gates Radio Company of Quincy, Illinois\nhas been the sole manufacturer of fm broadcast\nequipment. The RCA announcement of a new fm\nline and now the I.T.A. announcement points up the\nfact that fm is again on the upswing. The announce¬\nments also emphasize the need for educational in¬\nterests to get busy and occupy these reserved chan¬\nnels while they are so easily available.\nJANUARY, 1958\n13"
