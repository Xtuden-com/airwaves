This\nrestriction prevents many of the broadcasters from operating during\nevening hours, others must use directional antennae that limit coverage\nin their rightful service area, and some large state institutions find\nthat they cannot have an outlet because of no available facilities.\nHone of the state institutions operating educational stations is able\nto approach the coverage of their state, either day or night. There¬\nfore, we, as educational broadcasters, respectfully submit to the\nCommission that the needs of educational broadcasters should be con¬\nstantly kept in mind in any development or change which might result\nin the availability of additional AM facilities.\nFM BROADCASTING BAND:\nIt is apparent to the membership of the National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters that EM broadcasting offers limitless\npossibilities to improve and expand the educational broadcast service.\nSome of the members have pioneered in EM broadcasting while others\nare ready to start in this field as soon as the necessary equipment\nis available. Some construction permits have already been granted\nand a number of applications have either been submitted or are in\nthe process of being prepared.\nEducational FM stations propose to offer direct to school\nbroadcasting during school hours and adult extension classes during\nevening hours as well a.s a balanced program of cultural and informative\nofferings for general consumption. In the field of direct school\nbroadcasting there are many opportunities to supplement the teaching\nby people recognized as authorities in their respective fields,\nespecially in rural areas where there is neither time nor tadent to\nteach some subjects properly.\n- 4 -"
