  "text": "Facsimile offers a written record of material which can he\nused during the progress of a given educational broadcast for nurposes\nof illustration and then later for reference and review material. The\nproposed use includes the transmission of illustrations, pictures,\nmaps, and outlines. The only problem involved will be facilities to\ntransmit material fast enough to supplement all the services that will\nbe using educational broadcasting. The National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters will endorse any application of facsimile to\nFM broadcasting so long as there is no material impairment of FM audio\nfidelity. Many of the member stations contemplate the use of facsimile\nas soon as standards are set and reliable equipment is available.\nTelevision broadcasting offers an intimate, flexible, and\ntimely approach in educational programming. In the transmission of\ncurrent events alone lies reason enough for all educational broadcasters\nto look to television. The additional possibilities of, demonstration\nlectures, visits to points of educational interest, and televised field\ntrips, make it an invaluable educational tool.\nSeveral members of the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters have pioneered in television broadcasting and from their\nvast experience in this field they have learned the folly of trying\nto set up an expanded program of television service until definite\nstandards have been set up. Educational institutions cannot stand\nthe rapid obsolescense that hastily defined standards might lead to.\nThe membership will be willing to take up television just as soon as\nstandards are definitely set, and as soon as production makes teleÂ¬\nvision receiving equipment within the range of restricted school budgets.\nThere is no type of programming that fits television as well as\neducational broadcasting.\n- 6 -"
