Occasional¬\nly we refer to other items that month giving a page reference. Obviously this does\nnot refer to the page numbers of the Engineering Newsletter. This has caused some\nconfusion to our readers, but we hope this esqplanation will clarify matters.\nWe refer to a report on the Arnpex Video Tape Recorder which is not included in\nthis mailing. This report is available upon request. We also refer to a list of\nthose attending the Radio and Audio Engineering Seminar which we axe including.\nWe had hoped to include other articles of interest in this issue, however other\nwork has priority. Since this should have gone to press a month ago, so we'll\ninclude them in the next newsletter. We urge our readers to contribute to these\ncolumns. We need articles of interest to all technical personnel. Perhaps your\nideas, if published here, will save a fellow engineer much time and trouble in solv¬\ning the same problem.\nCecil S. Bidlack\nJuly 13, 1956"
