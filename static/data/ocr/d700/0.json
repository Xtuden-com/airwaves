Skornia\nFrom: Burton Paulu\nSubject: Report to Annual Convention. -\nAs you know, it is customary for NAEB committee chairmen to\nreport to the membership at the annual convention of the\nAssociation. In arranging these reports, we have found that it\nexpedites the presentations if each committee chairman supplies\nour headquarters with a written report which can be dittoed and\ndistributed at the convention. The chairman then need give only\na brief oral report, and be available for questions from the\nfloor.\nWould each of you who has not already done so, therefore,\nplease prepare a report of the activities of your committee\nduring the past year? The exact length, of course, depends upon\nhow much you have to say* I would suggest not more than three\nor four pages at the most, although a few paragraphs will be\nenough if you think that will suffice. These reports should be\nsent to headquarters by October 4 (14 Gregory Hall, University\nof Illinois, Urbana, Illinois) for dittoing and distribution at\nthe annual meeting."
