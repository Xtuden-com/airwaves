Keith ’Tyler\nFROM* Raymond Dc Cheydleur, Chairman\nREs Topics for Seminar\nDATE* September 27, 1957\nInadvertently the following material was left out of the two\nlists of materials on topics for the Seminar.\nSAM BECKER.9 Dirof Division of TV, Radio, Film, State\nUniversity of Iowa\nResearch Projects Now in Progress\n1) Comparison of different methods of using the audience**\nresponse device for securing program profiles0\n2) Comparison of three methods of teaching the normal\nlecture material is a communication skills course,\nlecture vs television recordings vs students simply\nreading books.\nTopics for the Seminar\nOn your question concerning topics to be taken up at\nColumbus, I think this same question can be broadened, how\nw© can standardise our research procedures so that we do\nnot run into the hassle that commercial research organizations\nhave over which of their surveys truly reflects the broadcast\naudience. ¥e need to first get some ideas on the major prob¬\nlems which need answering and which can be answered by re¬\nsearch® Many cannot. Perhaps we can then place these into\nthree categories, those which can best be done by each in¬\ndividual stations, those which are best done by a group of\ninstitutions working cooperatively, and those which should\nbe carried out by the NAEB with a central research group.\nThe last would include those large projects which will take\nfoundation support. I realize that this is vague but it is\nthe best I can offer today.\nC.C. Harry Skornia\nBurton Paulu\nDick Hull\nResearch Committee"
