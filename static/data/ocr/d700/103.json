WXAA-TV\nDear Harry i\nIn answer to your nano of August 9, our Director of Research la Dr. Irrtng\nMerrill, who has his A.B. from Cornell University, M.S. in journalism from\nthe University of Illinois, and Ph.D. in communications from the University\nof Illinois. He was an instructor in speech at Iowa State College in 191*5;\ndirector of radio and manager of the university educational radio station,\nUniversity of South Dakota, 191*6-50; instructor in journalism and communica¬\ntions, University of Illinois, 1950-5h, while working on his doctorate.\nSince 1951 he has been our Director of Research and Promotion for r«AR-T7,\nMichigan State University. I ara sure that you are familiar with his research\nactivities and with the various reports and studies we have done, several\nof which have been under NAEB grant and with NAEB assistance.\n) 1 think the Seminar might discuss the problem of developing research studies\nI to evaluate the relative audience interest and effectiveness of different\ntypes and kinds of educational, programs on a qualitative basis. I know that\nthere are some studies moving in this direction; but I believe that educa¬\ntional broadcasting in general should put a prior emphasis upon qualitative\nresearch and audience learning and enlightenment studies rather than quanti¬\ntative and numerical measurement factors.\nI am confident that Irv will have his own suggestions and ideas for additional\nproblems and questions for discussion should he be selected for participation\nin the Research Seminar.\nBeet always.\nDirector\nALH/im\nAugust 12*, 1957\nMr. Harry J. Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nlh Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois"
