As Direc¬\ntor of the Experimental Study in Instructional Procedures here at Miami Uni¬\nversity, 1 am directly responsible lor the TV instructional program and re¬\nsearch on teaching through television. Dr. Laurence Siegel, Assistant Direc¬\ntor of ESIP is our evaluation a-alyst lr the program *od responsible, under\nmy supervision, for the actual researi n activities. Dr. Siegel is a Psycholo¬\ngist, with special training and experience m the field oi e a’uation. Conse¬\nquently, if you wanted someone to disc use research findings and who was\nthoroughly at home with the research techniques and vocabulary, Dr. Siegel\nwould be the person best qualified of the staff here. My own training and ex¬\nperience is chiefly in the curriculum field, including curriculum research. I\nam more directly interested, however, in improving ways and means of tele¬\nvision teaching than in the actual measurement of learning per se,\nI hope the above information will be helpful to you in planning the\nNAEB Research Seminar for next December.\nSincerely yours\nF.
