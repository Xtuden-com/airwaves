Even the most popular com¬\nmercial stations today find this competition to be extremely\nsevere.\nIn addition to the station-by-station detail, available to you\nby such a purchase, we furnish a U. S. listing of radio and\nTV homes by county and a statistical summary of soire of the\nmore important dimensions of radio and TV, including hours of\nset use, location of receivers, out-of-home listening and view¬\ning, etc.\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing descriptive brochures\nwhich clarify the research techniques used and the types of\ninformation available. If your Association group is interested\nin acquiring any of this information under the types of terms\nI have indicated, I will be most happy to supply you with the\nnecessary contract detail. It is perhaps unfortunate that\nour reporting standards eliminate so many of your members, but\non the other hand, a tremendous amount of information is avail¬\nable from this source. Any study designed to gather more\nspecific detail on lower activity levels than those reported\nby us would be found to be tremendously expensive. For example,\nto merely lower the standards to % of all homes would require\na doubling of the samples used by us, but even then, with less\nassurance of accuracy.\nIf there is any further information that I can supply you,\nplease do not hesitate to write or phone me.\nCordially,\nA. C. NIELSEN COMPANY\nJKC/mlf\nENCLS.\nJohn K. Churchill\nVice President\nccj Dr. H. J. Skornia\nMr. Raymond Cheydleur\nMr. Burton Paulu"
