S& w'/e,\nDr. Skornia:\nRe the attached: xtx it appears that the Network has never carried any of these programs.\nThis is the conclusion reached after examining the tape utilization charts, all the old\nofferings (in-school and general), and all old submissions (in-school and general). I have\nasked Glenn and Janet if they ever heard of these programs. Glenn says no; Janet recalls\nreading about a couple of them in press xmric&x releases received, but says that we never\ncarried them.\nIt has dawned on me that the Network woujbd never carry a series entitled: \"Summer High\nSchool Make-Up Course,\" one of the programs Hall requested information about. Perhaps he\nhas our programs mixed up with somebody elseâ€™s list of programs.\nDo you have any suggestions on future action?\n3/7/56"
