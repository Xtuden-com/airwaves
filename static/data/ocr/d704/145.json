I also note that\nHarry Skornia has a comment about the exclusive phrase. Since you\nfolks are the experts on tape reproduction and the procedures and costs\ninvolved, I have made no sxtensivo comment on these points} however,\nI think both of us should ascertain what Kent State would propose to\ncharge and decide whether or not it is appropriate.\nI assume that if we all come to a common understanding as to\nJust how to handle the deposit and distribution of radio program tapes\nat Kent State we can then get in touch with Ralph Hall and work out\nsome relatively simple letter agreement to cover the procedures. Also,\nperhaps the arrangement should Isave us with an opportunity to changs\nit or withdraw depsading on ths situation as it develops in the future.\nSincerely,\nKLY:mjl\ncc: Mr. Harry J.\nSkornia\nHarold E.
