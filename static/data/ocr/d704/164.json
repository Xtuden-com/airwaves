Tf no, on whet basis? This\nwould be for Audiovisual use only, of course, since we handle\nall broadcast distribution ourselves*\nWithin the neat few days you will receive from Robert Underwood,\nour letweris ?toagu>, a Hart of past and present Qrante-AiwAid\nprograms* as wen as a listing of those past norw&rarrt rsposrmm\nwhich might still be available for such audiovisual distribution\nend use*\nI'm not sure of the contractual agreements and conditions under\nwhich Indiana tfeiversity serves as the distribution center for\nthe Center for such uses (though it also serves as a distribution\ncenter for program to estsrasrcial stations, which probably would\nnot be Involved here*) Do you know or could you find out about\nthis?\nThis Is not to commit either the Center or the BABB to selection\nof Kent State for this, of course* ft depends on working out\nthe best possible solution to getting active use of the many usable\nmaterials we are beginning to have, and will have in the future*\nftat since wefve already worked with you in the past, we felt it\nonly fair to begin our discussions and considerations by writing\nyou*"
