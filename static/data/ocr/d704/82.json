G.\nDear Ann:\nI*m inclined to think the terms of our grant pretty positively prevent use of our\nWorkshop Funds far anything except educational television directly. Otherwise we\nwould be accused of trying to dominate in some way an area not our own. They are\nalso available only to educational institutions far the development of further\nand better offerings for training ETV station ami production center personnel,\nessentially (at least as defined in our grant). I wish we had funds available to\ndo what you suggest, because it is a mighty important need.\nI*m sorry about the three programs you can’t list, but I’m glad that you are able\nto get and list the rest of those discussed. At least that’s considerable progress,\neven though a little short of 100$.\nOur best at the holiday season.\nSincerely,\nHJSjdfc\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
