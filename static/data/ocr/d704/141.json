As it was going, we\nwere talking in generalities.\n2. We have no objection to others duplicating. (Par. 2 of\nHarry's letter). We do not want another center established\nout of the ETRC. Many state libraries obtain eveiything\nwe have and duplicate on their own for their respective\nstates. We do not receive records on this type duplication.\nBut, we are for it since we are a service center for utilisation.\n3. Ref. Far. 3â€” We have no objection to NAEB duplication. This\nis similar to Par. 2.\nU. Par. 5 - Sines we should look to the future, I see no reason\nwhy we should not \"encourage\" member stations to deposit\ntheir material. Schools should be able to look to a tingle\nsource for good educational recordings.\nMay we hear from you soon ss we would like to get moving during\nthe summer slack period if everything is acceptable. The Fall finds\nus swamped getting the new material for the National Catalog and fall\norders in shape.\nFeel free to change the \"agreement11 to fit your thinking. If we\ndon't agree on given points we then can iron them out.\nSincerely yours.\nRalph H. Hall, Coordinator\nAudio-Visual Center\nRHHicv\nCC: Robert Underwood\nHarold S. Hill ^\nAnn Hyer\nJdL o JS&f"
