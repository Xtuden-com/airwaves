Skornia\nNAEB\nSeptember 3, 1957\nlip Gregory Hall ‘\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI have just read Kenneth Yourd*s letter of August 8\nrelative to the proposal of Ralph Hall of Kent State\nUniversity.\nIt looks as though Ken*s comments are quite all right.\nDo you, Harold and Bob Underwood want to draw up a state¬\nment outlining your suggestions? Do you want me to? Or do\nyou want to draw one up for me to send to Kent State?\nIt doesn*t make any difference to me which procedure\nwe follow, although it seems less cumbersome for you folks\nto work out the details, since this is a problem with which\nyou are more closely involved than anyone else.\nMeanwhile, I will merely acknowlege with thanks the\nletter from Ken Yourd (a copy enclosed)\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:kls"
