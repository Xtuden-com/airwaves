It reads? nAny areas not specifically\ncovered in this agreement must be submitted to both parties\nand agreement reached.\" Literally construed, this would mean\nthat anything anywhere not covered by this agreement (and that*s\nan awful lot!) must b© mad© the subject subsequent agreements\nbetween both parties, I assume that what is meant here is that\nmatters pertaining to the distribution of ETRC and NAEB programs\nby Kent State which are not specifically covered by this agreement\nwill have to be made the subject of separate negotiations; this\nis not clearly stated.\nI hope that my observations will make sense and that they\nare helpful. It is natural that someone as close to this as\nyou are should assume certain things to be understood. I think\none of the best roles those of us a little further removed can\ncontribute, is to point out wherein the agreement may be indefinite.\nYours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:kls\nCCi Harry J.
