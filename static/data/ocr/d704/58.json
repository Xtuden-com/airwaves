C.\nDear Ann:\nAttention to the form for reporting series available\nto the DAVI-AERT Tape Becording Project returned me to a\nsubject I have been meaning to discuss with you. It has to\ndo with the relationship between the BAVI project and the\nMSB Tape Network.\nIs it known to what extent DAVT tape customers use\nthe tapes for broadcast? I suspect the tapes are seldom\nused for broadcast, but you could judge much better than I\nby examining the list of users. I strongly suggest that\nthe Order Form be modified to provide columns in which the\nuser would Indicate whether or not tapes were to be used\nfor broadcast and if so, over what stations.\nIf it should become apparent that broadcast use is\nnot a vital part of DAVI tape utilization, then migfrt it\nnot be desirable to establish the policy that DAVI tapes\nmay be used only for non-broadcast purposes? Such a policy\nwould result in at least two important advantages. First,\nduplication of effort would be reduced. The NAEB is well\nestablished with its Tape Network which makes a good variety\nof series available to educational stations for a reasonable\ncharge. On the other hand, the NAEB, as I understand it,\ndoes not ordinarily furnish tapes for non-broadcast use.\nThe area of tapes for classroom playback is a vast one with\na great potential and a growing demand. I think this is the\narea of DAVI-AERT responsibility. The needs for broadcast\ntapes and for classroom tapes are both so important that\nareas of re sensibility should be chosen to make possible\nthe concentration of energies without overlapping."
