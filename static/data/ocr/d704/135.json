Among several\narticles planned is a pro and con treatment of subscrip¬\ntion television. The magazine1s editorial committee has\nsuggested that I contact you in regard to the pro argu¬\nment. Would you be willing to contribute your time and\neffort to furnish us with this article,?\nWe do not yet have a \"con\" author; we are soliciting\nsuggestions from Mr. Steele of JCET, but if you have\nany suggestions we would like to have them also.\nPAUL W. F. WITT\nProfessor of Education, Teachers\nCollege, Columbia University\nNational Staff\nFLOYDE E. BROOKER\nExecutive Secretary\nANNA L. HYER\nAssociate Executive Secretary\nFLORENCE IH-CHI FAN\nAdministrative Assistant\nMARY C. WELCH\nAdministrative Assistant\nOur articles usually run around 1500 words, less if they\nare illustrated. Can you think of any way to illustrate\nan article on this subject—photos or otherwise? The\ndeadline for November articles is September 1.\nAs it is now planned the November issue will contain art¬\nicles on the following subjects: a round-up of ETV exper¬\niments in public schools throughout the country; a sim¬\nilar round-up on the college level; pros and cons of sub¬\nscription television; unsolved problems in ETV (this\nwill probably be a digest of the findings of DAVI*s\nworkshop and seminar to be held in August-Sept ember);\nTV equipment; building facilities that look to a future\nof ETV; and, legal aspects of ETV."
