As I recall Kitty told me that you were plannÂ¬\ning to attend the convention if at all possible. This\nwas probably the reason that your name was not omitted\nfrom the committee listing. I assume that Mr. Bell sent\na letter of thanks to all those whose name appeared in\nthe program. The national office sent letters of thanks\nonly to those who registered. I regret this error.\nERNEST TIEMANN\nDirector, Visual Instruction Bureau,\nUniversity of Texas\nPAUL W. F.
