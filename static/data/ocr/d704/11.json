MeCabe Day, Director\nAudio-Visual Center\nSchool City of Huntington\nHuntington, Indiana\nDear Mac:\nAnother hasty note, after re-reading your letter, I arrive Monday after¬\nnoon. I haven’t seen a program and don’t know when I’m on, except Tuesday\nat 10 a.m.\nI’d also like to get you together with Ralph Hall and others, because I\nam now back from a \"Joint Committee* meeting of Audio-Visual people (it\nwas chaired by Don williams of Syracuse, who said he was often tempted\nflatly to oppose ETV, for example), which also greatly worried me by\naiming at being \"the god* of teaching materials.\nI’ll count on time to \"counsel together\" with you men, and shall ask that\nyou be included in the Hall meetings, if possible, since you’re both audio¬\nvisual and radio-TV. I’ll be staying at the Sheraton-Cadillac. Leave me a\ncouple of suggested pow-wow days and times, and we’ll get together with any\npersons you’d like to include, informally.\nSincerely,\nHJSjjy\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
