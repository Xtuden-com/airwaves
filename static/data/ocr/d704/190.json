Hall, Coordinator\nAudio-Visual Center\nKent State University\nKent, Ohio\nDear Ralph*\nSorry, I’ve been at meetings all but two days this month, until today.\nActually I think the topic you mention could be commented on too briefly\nto justify sy coming. Whether we like it or not, we are only a network\nof member stations — though we meet occasional other requests for\ntapes, usually from member institutions• I’m afraid my contribution\nwould be so lane and inadequate that it would hardly justify my either\nspeaking or leading such a session. Bob Underwood, our Network Manager,\nfeels about the same way about it.\nI*m rather surprised usually to find us listed in such capacities in\nview of the fact that we in the NAEB devote most of our energies to\nETV and educational radio at the educational philosophy, research and\nprofessional advancement levels. With the demand for our participation\nin areas w© are equipped to speak intelligently in already so great, I\ndon't believe we could justify my trip and time for the panel you mention.\nThis is not to say it's not important. But with only four of \"us boys*\nhere, including network Manager and TV Engineer, we're so blasted busy\nwith so many other things I thought I should be frank. I hope you under¬\nstand.\nCordially,\nHJS/dfc\nGCs Burton Paulu\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
