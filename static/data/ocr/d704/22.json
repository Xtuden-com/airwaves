However, the\nseries we ran were from KUOM, not Kent State University.\nI don’t think we have any rights or any further interest in the PEOPLE ACT series.\nI agree that we should hang onto the AMERICAN ADVENTURE series for at least\na year or two Before releasing to anybody outside NAEB.\nAs for the in-school series, the committee thinks that the right to release\nshould belong to the originating station only, and that the station should\nbe discourgaged from releasing to any but NAEB. We are holding most of the\nin-school tapes now with a view to re-release at later dates."
