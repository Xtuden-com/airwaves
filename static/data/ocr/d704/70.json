HYER\nAssociate Executive Secretary\nDear Bob:\nAs you know, I have written to the producers of several of the\nseries carried in the NAEB Network concerning their possible\nrelease for use in the AERT-DAVI Tape Recording Project. One\nquestion has come up which will have a bearing on whether or\nnot we will be able to utilize this program source.\nIn a letter to Ralph Hall, you stated that you would make\nmasters for the Listen America Series, produced by the Univer¬\nsity of North Carolina, at a charge of $2.00 per reel. The\nproject does not have funds to make such payment possible*\nMy question is this$ do we have the right to make our own\nmasters as we do with other programs? or, is it necessary for\nus to have you prepare masters of those programs in the NAEB\nNetwork listings which we wish to carry? If the latter is\ntrue, there is no point in our going further in our negotia¬\ntions with the producers.\nIn the past, we have worked in one of the two following ways:\n(l) Either the producer sent tapes to Kent State,\nrecordings were made and the original tapes\nreturned to the producer, or\nFLORENCE IH-CHI FAN\nAdmlnstratlve Assistant\nMARY C. WELCH\nAdminstrative Assistant\n(2) the producer prepared masters and sent them to\nKent and we reimbursed them for the tape used\nto produce the masters.\nIn other words, there was a mailing of tape, but no financial\npayment.\nI will be at your meeting in Atlanta, and would appreciate some\nclearance of this matter at that time if you do not find time to\nreply by letter earlier.\nSincerely,\nALH:JMC Associate Executive Secretary"
