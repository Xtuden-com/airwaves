I hope\nyou eventually get many more.\nI hope Bob has by now sent you brochures (and mentions of albums) for Jeffersonian\nHeritage and 'Nays of Mankind I. Did you decide against Ways of Mankind II? The\nFAE found the second series the most useful of the two, and brought out special\ndiscussion group albums entitled Ways of Justice, for this.\nSee you in Atlantic City, I trust.\nSincerely,\nHJSjdfc\nHarry J.
