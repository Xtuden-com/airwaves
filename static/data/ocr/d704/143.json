MICHIGAN\nAugust 3, 1957\nMr. Burt cm Paulu\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nStation KUOM\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis 14, Minnesota\nDear Burt:\nHere are some factual comments on the proposal which Ralph\nHall of Kent State University made to Harry Skornia in June;\n1# At the outset it should be made clear that we are speaking\nonly of radio programs* This is probably implied in the\nKent State letter but nowhere is it stated.\n2. There are no radio programs produced ”bye’ the ETRC.\nETRC ie not a production center hut makes grants -in-aid\nto various stations to aid in the production of radio pro*\ngrams.\n3. ETRC does not control' all rights. ETRC (and before it\nNASS} secured from institutions producing the programs\nonly the radio broadcasting rights. It is not a matter of\nrecord mid not known whether the various producing organ!*\n3 at ions secured anything more than radio broadcasting\nrights (with TV rights to the title, idea, format, and scripts).\n4. The master tapes of all grant programs done in the past\nhave been shipped to NAEB headquarters and retained there\nin order to reproduce tapes for NAEB's member stations\nfor radio broadcasting.\nWith the facts straight*-here are some comments:\na. We have all had the experience of trying to go back and\nclear up or obtain additional rights to programs after they\nhave been recorded and I for one will go on record as say\ning that it is a difficult and many times impossible task."
