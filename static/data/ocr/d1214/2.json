  "text": "4\npoint communication for the benefit of pre-selected minority audiences\ncan be more appropriately conducted, says the FCC staff, via other\nkinds of disbribution systems.\nImportance to Education\nWhatever plan is finally adopted at the conclusion of the hearings\n(the whole rule-making procedure will run about six months) wilLcondition the\npattern of UHF and, thus, educational, TV (since its growth must be in this\nband) for at least the next decade.\nEducators and representatives of communities where educational\nfacilities exist or are planned will need to examine the new plan carefully\nto see if their needs have been fully taken into account for the provision of\none, two, or more assignments. In particular, they will need to decide whether\nthe FCC has been too conservative in providing no more than two ETV\nassignments in any location.\nAssessment of the Task\nThe FCC staff is predisposed to place the highest priority on the\nallocation of one educational reservation in every good-sized community.\nIt is not disposed to make second channel reservations until the ‘requirements'\nfor three network outlets and at least one independent commercial station in\nmetropolitan areas are satisfied. Moreover, the FCC staff does not intend\nthat second-channel assignments in the 40 designated communities are to\nbe used primarily for point-to-point, in-school television. It wants to\ndevelop the 2 000 me band for such ‘supplementary4 service."
