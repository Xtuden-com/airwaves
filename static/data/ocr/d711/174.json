The inven¬\ntion of movable types by Gutenberg in the middle of the fifteenth century led\nto the renaissance of learning and to a wider dissemination of knowledge, but\nthe advent of radio and television offer the opportunity, only partially\nrealized so far, to accelerate the process, and especially through television\nto break down the language barriers that heretofore have separated peoples.\nEducators must use radio and television with the same serious purpose that\ninforms their use of textbooks, newspapers, magazines, films, classroom\ndemonstrations, lectures, pictures and all the various devices employing sight\nand sound, for in this period of conflicting ideologies, radio and television\nare powerful forces for good or evil. Our cultural survival, our democratic\nway of life, in no small measure may depend upon the wise use of radio and\ntelevision. Since training for effective living in our modern world is a\nprimary purpose of education, and education may be defined as purposive\ncommunication leading toward socially approved goals, it is imperative that\nschools use radio and television with the same serious purpose with which\nthey employ other teaching resources. Radio and television are not in\ncompetition with other media of instruction nor are they to be thought of as\nsubstitutes for the teacher. They provide a related supplementary learning\nexperience that educators have long recognized as invaluable in achieving\nsuperior results, or they may be used as the dominant media, and be supple¬\nmented by other media. (This is discussed at greater length in the report on\nUtilization.)\nThe steadily increasing number of school stations indicates that American\neducators have recognized the importance of radio as an educational tool.\nIn 1939 there were fewer than 30 educational stations in the United States."
