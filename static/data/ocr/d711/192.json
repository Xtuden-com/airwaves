For example,\n*\nthe University of Chicago made transcriptions of the Peoria Riot including\n*Ben Bloom, Examiner's Office, University of Chicago, Report in Allerton\nSeminar, June 19, 1952.\nconversations with people who were witnesses or participants. Tests revealed\nthat 98$ rather than the usual 60% of the thought processes of the listeners\nwere overtly tuned to what was going on. Obviously radio would be the proper\nmedium for this wholly verbal program. Dr. Bloom cited the United States Army\nfilm on venereal disease which was recalled for revision when it was discovered\nthat the incidence of venereal disease increased after showing the film,\nrather than lessened. The visual cues were stronger than the aural — the\nactress cast as the prostitute was provocatively beautiful. Perhaps the fault\nlay in casting; perhaps the same script over radio with an actress possessed\nof a seductively beautiful voice in the role of the prostitute might have pro¬\nduced the same bad effect. But in programming consider whether radio or tele¬\nvision can convey your message more effectively and choose your medium accord¬\ningly. On the evidence of a one hour lecture followed by discussion the\nExaminer's Office of the University of Chicago found that by reproducing major\nsound and visual cues they could achieve almost total recall both overt and\ncovert. But the experiment also showed that sound cues were more effective\nthan sight cues; within 48 hours there was a 95~98$ accurate recall and within\n16 days a 65$ recall of things susceptible of checking. Visual cues were not\neffective because students were seeing different things: the need of a shave,\nthe reflections of light on the balding brow of the instructor and other\nerratic visual associations. In other words the viewer selects from the\ntotal picture those things of interest to him."
