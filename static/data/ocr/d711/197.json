Nec¬\nessarily the objectives of the school system and the particular department of\ninstruction must be observed, but under proper direction and guidance the\nneeds of both broadcasting and education can be met. At the same time the\nscript students have had a valuable learning experience. Adaptations of\nshort stories, dramas, and novels are well within the range of high school\nstudents and the gifted teacher can achieve scripts of professional quality.\nWriting for educational radio and television has not been fully explored. New\ntechniques...new variations of older forms...the constant quest for the right\nword...the telling dramatic statement...all serve to keep interest in writing\nat a high level.\nTalent\nFor our purpose talent may be defined as the actor or speaker to whom is en¬\ntrusted the responsibility for breathing proper life into script and evoking\nat the highest level the message or communication values of the script. In\nother words talent must meet the standards previously set forth. Although the\nuse of professional talent is highly desirable, the majority of school radio\nand television stations will be forced to use local talent: school or commun¬\nity. Talent from high school classes or workshops may be used if it approxi¬\nmates professional quality. But the schools are not limited to the use of\ntalent within their ranks. They may levy upon the resources of the community\nat large. For example, most communities include adults with some experience\nin college or community theaters who might welcome the opportunity to partici¬\npate in radio and television productions. Through evening classes or work¬\nshops in acting and production this adult talent can be trained for effective\nuse in educational programs."
