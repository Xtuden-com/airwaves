The excellent teacher, or even the physically\nattractive one, is not necessarily best for television use. The teacher\nchosen must have a personality which projects itself warmly and easily and\nacceptably and portrays the modern teacher as a well-informed, well-adjusted\nperson ideally equipped to stand in loco parentis. The ideal television\nteacher is poised and seemingly at ease, is quick in recognizing an emergency\nand adjusting to it, and possesses the sense of showmanship essential to good\nteaching."
