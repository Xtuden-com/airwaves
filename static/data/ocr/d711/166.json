  "text": "THE JEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE is history\nwith the dust blown off - living history - today\ncostumed as yesterday.\nThe story is authentic in historical spirit, while\nimaginative in form: the material is presented as a\ndramatization, and is thus very lively. (\nBehind this book is the planning and editorship of\nDumas Malone, author of Jefferson the Virginian,\nJefferson and the Rights of Man, and other Jeffer¬\nson studies. The writing was done by Morton\nWishengrad, Milton Geiger, Joseph Mindel, and\nGeorge Probst; and Claude Rains, as millions of\nAmericans know, played Jefferson. Beacon Press\npublishes it in cooperation with the National As¬\nsociation of Educational Broadcasters who pre¬\npared the series under a grant from the Fund for\nAdult Education established by the Ford Founda¬\ntion.\nThis presentation was honored by the National\nAssociation for Better Radio and Television as\n“the outstanding radio offering” of the year.\nThe chapters include:\nWhat the Jeffersonian Heritage Means\nToday\nThe Living Declaration\nThe Democrat and the Commissar\nDivided We Stand\nFreeing the Land\nTo Secure These Rights\nLight and Liberty\nThe Return of a Patriot\nThe Danger of Freedom\nThe Ground of Justice\nThe Experiment of a Free Press\nThe University of the United States\nNature’s Most Precious Gift\n168 pages, 12 full-page illustrations, $3.50"
