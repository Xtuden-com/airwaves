This report\ndoes not treat the TV problem adequately because no participant was operat¬\ning an educational TV station, though many were using commercial facilities\nfor broadcasting TV programs. For the television recommendations it suggests\na study of the reports on the subject issued by the Joint Committee on Educa¬\ntional Television; by the American Council on Education, A Television Policy\nfor Education by Carroll V. Newson, Editor; by the National Citizens Committee\nfor Educational Broadcasters, by the U.S. Office of Education-Radio-Television\nDivision; and by the Association for Education Radio and Television. A brief\nseries of recommendations of a general nature is included, for the experience\nin establishing a radio station should also serve as a general guide to estab¬\nlishing a television station. Any new radio station should modify these\nrecommendations with television in mind.\nAn important conclusion from the discussion was that the size and arrangement\nof an educational radio station depended upon the individual problem: how\nmuch space was available, the size of the appropriation, the kind of equipment,\nthe size of the staff, and experience of the staff with broadcast problems.\nFrom a survey of the Seminar participants adequate and properly arranged space\nwas found to be the primary factor in planning studios, control rooms, and\noffice. The quality of the station equipment and the amount of such equipment\nwere next in order of importance. In considering the suggestions following,\nit should be kept in mind that each situation offers a somewhat different\nproblem and demands individual planning."
