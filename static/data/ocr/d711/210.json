They are designed to protect the publishers\nrather than the original creator, the author or artist. In this respect\nEngland and the United States are in agreement. In neither country is there\nany legislation to protect the integrity of the author's or artist's idea.\nThe French attitude differs. Though the public purchases a piece of sculpture,\nthe artist retains the right to supervise its handling, setting, and location.\nIn the United States and England, the creator's rights are secondary to those\nof the publisher or producer.\nCopyright laws protect the creator and/or publisher for a period of twenty-\neight years, plus a renewal period of another twenty-eight years.\nEducational broadcasters will find the following classifications useful in\ndetermining whether materials they seek to broadcast are under copyright or\nusable without clearance from author, composer, or publisher:\nA. Music\nB. Music dramas\nC. Dramas\nD. Materials for oral delivery: sermons> addresses, dramatic\nrecitations\nE. Other literary materials, non-dramatic, not originally prepared\nfor oral delivery\nF. Program ideas\nG. Special problems of television copyright"
