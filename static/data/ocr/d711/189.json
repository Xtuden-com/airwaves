Are they broadcast regularly?\n9• Are they equal to other teaching aids ?\n10. Are they artistically satisfactory?\n11. If recorded, are the recordings technically satisfactory?\n12. Do they enrich and supplement the course of study?\nEach program director establishes the standards of his station by the wise\nselection of materials. It is wiser to broadcast a few hours of good programs\nthan to broadcast a full day’s schedule by eking out the broadcast schedule\nwith programs of indifferent quality.\nOnce live and transcribed programs are available their actual time-slot in\nthe day's program must be determined. The time needs of the classes using\nthe broadcasts is then of first importance. Local schedules differ and\ngeneralizations can not be made that would apply to all school systems, but\nthese suggestions grow out of group experience:\n1. For primary grades the program may be profitably shorter than fifteen\nminutes, but not much longer.\n2. Establish a time and day slot and keep it.\n3. Avoid adjacent scheduling of elementary school programs if there is\na known shortage of classroom receivers and time must be allowed for\nshifting them from one grade to another. Music interludes might be\nemployed between programs to allow for shifting.\nk. Equalize the number of programs for each grade level. It might be\nunwise to offer three lower elementary programs per week and none or\none for upper elementary classes, and vice versa.\n5. Consider the listening problem at the school level and re-broadcast\nas necessary to reach those classes varying from the standard schedule.\nJ"
