Bidlack, NAEB TV Engineer\nBiggest television news of the past month was made by the\nAmpex Corporation which demonstrated its new Video Tape Recorder\nin Chicago at the NARTB Convention. Ampex unveiled this latest\ndevelopment in video recorders April 14 when it demonstrated its\nnew and revolutionary process to over 200 CBS-TV affiliates.\nCBS-TV has ordered three prototype units at a cost of $75,000 each\nwhich it plans to use this fall to overcome the three hour time\ndifferential between the East and West Coasts.\nThis new video recorder was demonstrated all week during the\nNARTB Convention. The tape itself is two inches wide and moves\nat a speed of only 15 inches per second. An hour!s television\nprogram, both sound and picture, can be recorded on a 14 inch\nreel of tape with no processing involved. The tape can be re¬\nwound and played back immediately. It records frequencies as\nhigh as 4 me. to give 320 line resolution. A more complete des¬\ncription of this equipment is contained in a separate report\nenclosed with this Newsletter.\nMany new equipment developments were displayed in the\nExposition Hall of the Conrad Hilton Hotel in Chicago April 15-20"
