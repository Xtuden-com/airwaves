I certainly appreciate\nyour thoughtfulness and will endeavor to live up to your\nexpectations.\nAfter almost two months with the Network, I have concluded\nthat some improvements could be made in Network operations,\nboth here and wherever you happen to be. As space permits, I\nwould like to discuss some of these troubled areas without, I\nhope, getting into anyone’s hair.\nSubmissions. I am not going to comment on the number of\nsubmissions we receive, as that point has been discussed nu¬\nmerous times. However, let me say this: we never can have\ntoo many submissions. Enough said?\nIn the very near future, I hope to finalize a standard\nform for submissions plus a set of procedures to be used for\nsubmissions. There will be separate forms and procedures for\ngeneral offering programs and for in-school programs. I can¬\nnot place too much emphasis on the need for all of us (the\nstaff here as well as you) to follow these procedures. Be¬\nlieve me, absolute chaos reigns when submissions are not handled\nproperly. Therefore, your complete cooperation in this matter\nis needed.\nIn-School Offering. As you who do in-school broadcasting\nknow, we are offering the remaining fourteen programs of TALES\nFROM THE FOUR WINDS as a supplement to the regular offering.\nPlease place your order as soon as possible. We are running\non a pretty tight schedule these days, so to avoid delay in\nshipment please meet our deadline for ordering.\nAnd here is a special note for stations doing in-school\nbroadcasting: the Radio Network School Committee has moved\nthe deadline for submissions this year from Nay 1 to June 1.\nThus, those of you who planned to submit programs but could not\nmeet the May 1 deadline now have another month to forward\nyour submissions. We’ll be expecting them."
