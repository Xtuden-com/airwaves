W. 1-fell on\nEducational and Charitable Trust, has begun a task for which\nfuture generations will be in its debt—to transcribe onto\nfilm and sound track the attitudes of the worlds wise men.\nThe station has plans to hear from jurists like Learned Hand,\nscholars like Hu-Shih, scientists like Harold Urey, For the\nfirst wise man of its series, WQED chose a poet—New England*s\nRobert Frost. At eighty-two, Frost has won the Pulitzer\nprise for poetry four times, is regarded by many critics as a\nleading lecturer as wells spends half his days roaming his\ncountry, talking to people. Tapping the toe of a high-top shoe,\nhe says poems simple in sound, profound in thought, and\namazes his audience with the range of his knowledge. In\nPittsburgh in the constant presence of TV cameras he faced\naudiences of all character and dimension—fifth-graders and high\nschool students, lay adults and professional writers. He\naddressed thousands of students and as a finale was interviewed\nby admirer Jonas Salk, the famed medical researcher. In four\ndays of rambling discourse, Frost provided a sampling of the\nwit and wisdom that stamp a man as wise.\n(Colliers. April 27, 1956)\nWQED, Pittsburgh, which celebrated its 2nd year on the\nair April 1, and is the first community sponsored educational\nTV station, is looking forward to 67 hours-a-week of programming\nstarting this fall. This is quite a jump from the modest four\nhours of telecasting per week when the station first went on\nthe air in 1954« With the aid of grants from three foundations,\nthe people of the Pittsburgh community have made their station\ninto something to be proud of. Volunteers are the mainstay of\nthe station, both in raising money and putting on programs.\nMany programs produced by the station have won national ac¬\nclaim, and some of them have been rebroadcast over NBC."
