  "text": "OUTLINE TREATMENT FOR FILM IN KIT NUMBER 2\n\"ROLE OF THE CLASSROOM TEACHER\nThis outline treatment was developed In consultation with the members of the Advisory\nCommittee present at the N AE B National Convention in Austin.\nBused on considerations of budget and casting, the Committee recommended that in¬\nsofar as it is feasible, we confine the classroom sequences to one classroom and one\nteacher, working with a particular lesson, and it was the recommendation of the Com¬\nmittee members that this be an upper junior high school math lesson.\nIt is likely that we shall use a male teacher, as the television and classroom teachers in\nthe first two films (Nos. 3 and 5) have been women. However, it is possible that the\ncasting situation at the time of filming will dictate that the classroom teacher be a\nwoman.\nThe specifics of the lesson and the related activities will be worked out upon approval\nof this outline and the suggested subject area and level of lesson.\nmm\nDecember 15, 1964"
