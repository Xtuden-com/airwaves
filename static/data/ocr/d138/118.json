You can't expect these classroom\nteachers to accept this...right off the bat...without some idea of\nwhy it's being done..or how it's being done. And you certainly can't\nexpect them to believe...out of hand...that itâ€™s going actually to\nenhance their own roles...bringing them more into the heart of things\n...giving the classroom teachers themselves more important parts to\nplay with more supporting actors...giving them more time on stage for\nthe kind of parts they like best.\nAs a matter of fact, this whole teacher audition has been fraught\nwith difficulties because people didn't read the notices right\nannouncing the auditions. Do you remember what the poster said when\nyou came into the theater? Think back a minute.\nHe reaches over and unrolls a replica of the poster on the stage\ndoor wall. \"Is this what you remembered?\" he asks the viewers. He\npoints out that it says \"New Roles\"...and explains that a good many of\nthe people in the company^ead this as \"New Cast.\" Some left, thinking\nthey had been fired...or would be..Some retreated in tears to their\ndressing rooms. And others got all wrought up like Miss __...\ndown there with the Director now...and gafee us a piece of their minds.\nWell, we're going to give it back to them...after we've worked\non it a little while and changed it a bits we hope. Because \"New\nRoles\" doesn't have to mean new people. It can and most often does"
