You know what\nthe designer said?\nHe said, since we were still experimenting with our action plan.\n..and since he didn't know...because we didn't know...just what kind\nof action and interaction were to go on inside this setting...he’d\ndesign a building to accommodate just ANY kind. Do you think he\nsucceeded?\nProducer exhibits design similar to the one attached and\ncalls attention to some of the salient features.\nHe explains that the designing architect didn't know what to call\nthis...because he wasn't sure what it would be called on to do or be.\nHe didn't want anything too \"arty\"...because it must serve a very\nrealistic and practical function...and he didn't want anything too\n\"down to earth\" because it mustn't serve banal and humdrum ends.\nWe decided...since it opened a workable way to almost anything we\nmight want to do in THE LEARNING PROCESS...and to almost anywhere we\nmight want to do it...we’d call it \"Access\". What do you think of\nthat title? Does it \"square\" with your idea of a learning environment?\nOr perhaps you'd rather not decide just yet. Maybe you'd rather\nkeep this set in mind and reserve judgment, until you see how the\nwhole production is shaping up...who's going to get what role and how\nall these elements will \"play\" together.\nBut don't forget about \"Access.\" Keep checking back in your mind\nto see if what shapes up will fit in....if this setting is appropriate"
