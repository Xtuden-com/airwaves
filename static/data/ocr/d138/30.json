Conquering space, it offers to the best\nteachers a wider range of influence and a richer form of discourse.\nTo the humblest of us it provides a spur to emulate the best in others,\nmore time to think and work, a chance to give in fuller measure of\nsuch talent and demotion as we can muster. For each and all of us,\nteachers and learners alike, it spells out what we most urgently\ncrave.. .more opportunity for coping with our special needs and\nproblems., .a heightened potential for learning.\nCONCLUSION:\nNARR: Suppose I should ask you now: â€œHow do you look at television?\nDo you think you may have found some new answers?"
