But each must learn whatever he learns\nfor himself. Therefore, all elements of instruction...the school...\nthe teacher... the classroom... the textbook.. .pictures... charts...\nmaps...globes...radio...television...self-instructional devices\nof alt kinds...are merely instruments in the SELF-EDUCATION\nof our children. The merits of television, like the merits of any other\ninstrument, lie in what it can do best for which student and under\nwhat circumstances.\n(4) We are finding that television has special uses in such areas as\ngroup guidance, physical education, driver training, where detailed\nclose-up demonstrations can be made much more effectively than in\na large classroom with a live presentation.\n(5) One of the major impacts of educational television may be on\nteaching method, and one of its major contributions may be to the\nimprovement of teaching method. Teaching by television is\ndifferent from other teaching. It imposes a sharper discipline\nupon method; it increases the use of a variety of devices as\nteaching aids; it introduces innovations that can affect all teaching,\nin the classroom, for self-evaluation for those whose presentation is\ntaped. And it is at its best in the team-teaching situation, where\neach teacher stimulates the other, where each learns from observing\nthe other."
