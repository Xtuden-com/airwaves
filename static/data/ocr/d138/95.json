  "text": "Outline - Film 2: Role of the Classroom Teacher\n(2) It is a unique and crucial role calling for specialized contributions\nwhich nobody else can make.\nThe role itself has not changed, says the Narrator. The classroom teacher is\nstill director of the learning activities, creator of the learning climate. But\nthere has been a change in emphasis.\nNo longer do we find the classroom teacher expending the major part of his time,\ninterest, and energy here... in the presentational area of the classroom. (We see\nthe television teacher on screen.) With that area in the helpful hands of a presentation\nspecialist, who is responsible for the common body of general knowledge to be shared\nby ail the children.. .it is here (as we see the pupils in the classroom) that the\nunique effectiveness of the classroom teacher will be concentrated.. .in the close\nand specialized relationships with the students in his own class.\nSo you see, says the Narrator, when you find rabbit ears in the classroom, it makes\nno difference whether they are attached to this (a rabbit) or to this (a television\nreceiver). The role of the classroom teacher is still intact. He is still in control\nof the classroom."
