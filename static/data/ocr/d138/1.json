One of the screens (which\nshould be almost full screen size on our viewing screen) can carry the title of the\nfilm, followed quickly by the subtitle.\n\"POTENTIAL FOR LEARNING\"\nA Searching Look at Television\nWe can end the animated sequence with a pair of eyes which, as we pull out, turn\nout to be the eyes of the Narrator.\nOR . . . (AND I LIKE THIS BETTER) ... we can pull back from the screen\ncarrying the title and subtitle to reveal a television receiver in a home. Facing\nthe TV set at an angle, so we can't see the face of the person in the chair, is a large\neasy chair. We can see (in sequence ... as they are mentioned in the narration . .\nthe chair, the unshod feet, the TV table with the snack, and the hand with a glass of\nmilk.\nNARR: (Speaking from the chair)\nIf I should ask you: \"How do you look at television?\". . . what would\nyou say?\nFrom an easy chair?\nWith my shoes off?"
