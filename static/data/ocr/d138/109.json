(and his\npencil points out the specifics). . .\nThis was our old setting for THE LEARNING PROCESS. The one we\njust took off the boards. And there’s been a lot of disagreement over\nwhether we oughtn’t to stick with it. Always is, you know, when you\nget ready to change something folks’re used to. We’d played in this\nset, one cast after another, for a good long time. And there are those\nwho say: \"If it was good enough for some of the greats. . . it's good\nenough for me. \"\nBut a lot of the people involved have complained for quite a while that\nit's rigid and cumbersome and confining. And you can see, can’t you. . .\nwhere they've got a point?\nFor instance, in the production recently concluded. . . separate parts\nof the action took place in these separate little areas of the big set.\nEach little group performed in one of these little cubicles. If they got\nout of it. . . they just moved. . . in a body. . . into another little area. . .\nand another group moved into the one they left.\nWell, the teachers and the pupils both complain that it restricts their\nperformance. And you can see how it would. The sightlines are wrong.\nThere's no opportunity for imaginative grouping. There's no interplay\nbetween the areas. . . and one group can’t see what the other’s doing. . .\nThey say we need a new setting. . . that the essence of the whole production\nis suffering from antiquated ideas of presentation, of structure, of\ndynamics, of staging."
