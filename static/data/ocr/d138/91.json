And then let's\nsee if the true measure of classroom teacher\ncontrol is actually so very different after all.\n7. OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE\nThe Narrator suggests that we start our exploration in the classroom where we\nfind the classroom teacher at his desk.. .familiarizing himself with the Teacher's\nGuide.. .using the Guide and a calendar to plan his work and the activities of the\nclass in the days to come. Part of his planning will be directed toward the general\nobjectives and specific goals of the lessons as indicated in the Teacher's Guide. The\nNarrator and the teacher illustrate a few brief specifics of this planning.\nHowever, says the Narrator, as the teacher looks up, seeing individuals among\nthe children in the classroom, a most important part of his planning will be directed\ntoward using the television lessons in the ways most appropriate to the special interests\nand individual needs of the pupils.. .and (as we see the class as a whole) toward\nfitting the lessons to this particular class and its specific situation. (In this sequence,\nas the teacher goes through the Guide, turning pages of the calendar, making notations\non points in the calendar, or in the Guide, the Narrator mentions briefly some of the\nnotations he may make. Calendar notations will alert the teacher to such things as\nfilms to be ordered, references or resources to be secured from the library or elsewhere,\ntextbooks or workbook assignments or correlation, special authorities to be invited, field\ntrips to be made, materials to be prepared or to have on hand,etc.)"
