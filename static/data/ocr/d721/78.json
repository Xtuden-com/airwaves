To me, a children’s program\nshould first have permanent value.\nBy that I mean, it should possess\nqualities that would make it good\nAmericana; future peoples could\ntake it out of a cornerstone and\nsay, “That was Mid-20th Century!”\nIt provides a base upon which fu¬\nture appreciation could be realiz¬\ned. It possesses even some of the\nGreek qualities before the Coming\nof Christ—of the good, the true,\nand the beautiful.\n2. The program should give\ngood motivation. It should set up\nhabits of love of family, of neigh¬\nbor, of all human creatures; of wise\nuse of time—work-a-day or leisure;\nof good character.\n3. It should give, if possible, a\nspiritual lift — it should make us\nfeel “warm inside” for having seen\nor heard it. It should make us feel\nthat we have gained something for\nhaving viewed it; our courage\nshould be increased, our weaknesses\nrecognized.\nThe commercial television net¬\nworks do not consider themselves\neducational institutions. Their pri¬\nmary purpose is to serve the pub¬\nlic interest through news, entertain¬\nment, sports, and special events. In\nthis, they are like newspapers.\nNeither, however, can escape the\nresponsibility to cooperate complete¬\nly with the educational forces of\nthe nation; and while maintaining\ncirculation, in the one case and au¬\ndience in the other, they do so\nto the best of their ability. Edu¬\ncational TV stations have the di¬\nrect responsibility for education\nover the air.\nNo one can gainsay the fact that\nmuch education is concealed with¬\nin entertainment. It would not\nharm education, either, to use the\nshowmanship which the entertain¬\nment world has been forced to mas-\n. . . should have a\npermanent value . . .\nter in order to stay in business, for\nboth require an expert knowledge\nof human nature.\n® I HAVE DIVIDED arbitrarily\nthe youthful viewing public into\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
