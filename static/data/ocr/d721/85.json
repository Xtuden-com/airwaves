The\nviews of parents proved as diverse\nas those of authors of articles on\ntelevision.\n• THEREFORE the purpose of\nthis study was to analyze the tele¬\nviewing habits and preferences, and\nthe reactions to programs teleview¬\ned, by children in grades one\nthrough twelve in all the public and\nparochial schools in Ann Arbor,\nMichigan; to determine the role of\ntelevision in the lives of these child¬\nren, to study its impact, if any, on\ninformal and formal education; and\nto suggest ways in which this new\nmedium may be used constructively\nin education.\nIn the few studies that have been\nmade of the effect of television on\nchildren, no attention has been given\nto length of set ownership. No dis¬\ntinction has been made between\nDo children view\nfor countless hours?\nnew set owners and those who have\nhad them for six months or longer.\nIn the final analysis, the practical\nproblem for educators is what TV\nownership will do to children after\nthey have had their receivers long\nenough to develop lasting habits.\nPreliminary interviews with sever¬\nal hundred pupils in grades three\nthrough twelve revealed that after\nsix or seven months of TV receiver\nownership, they began to reduce\ntheir televiewing time approximate¬\nly 50 per cent and to establish de¬\nfinite patterns of televiewing. The\ninvestigator therefore decided to\nuse as subjects only those children\nwho had had receivers for six\nmonths or longer.\nSince television began there have\nbeen arguments as to the number\nof hours children spend in front of\ntheir television sets. Estimates of\nthe number of hours spent each\nday have varied from one to six or\neight hours daily. These numbers\nhave been based solely on guess ap¬\nproximations given by parents of\nthe children themselves. The in¬\nvestigator was not satisfied with\nresults obtained from memory. A\nfar more precise method appeared\nto be the diary system, developed\nfor radio in 1942 and used by CBS\nand NBC for successful analysis\nof listening habits of radio au¬\ndiences. Following this model, a\nTV diary was prepared by the au¬\nthor and pre-tested. It proved a\nsuccessful method of recording the\nteleviewing patterns of children.\nFor this reason it was chosen as\nthe instrument for collecting the\nnecessary data for the investiga¬\ntion.*\nThe investigation was conducted\nin all sixteen public and parochial\nschools in the city of Ann Arbor.\nMichigan, contact being made with\nall pupils from the first grade\nthrough the twelfth. This is the\nfirst television survey to be made\nanywhere in the nation that cover¬\ned all grades and used the length\nof set ownership as the controlling\n* For a description of the diary technique,\nsee John Churchill, “CBS Listener Diary\nStudy,” Education on the Air, 14th yearbook\n(1943), pp. 335-339.\nNOVEMBER 1956\n11"
