Re¬\nhearsals will be necessary, especially in\nrespect to timing each broadcast.\nIt is anticipated that the instructor will\nspend more time preparing for his tele¬\nvision programs than for his class¬\nroom presentations of the same material.\nAlso, it is anticipated that he will have\nmore assignments to read and grade than\nhe has in most of his campus courses.\nThis increased demand upon the instruc¬\ntor’s time will be taken into account by\nthe dean in planning the instructor’s\nteaching load. The exact details will be\narranged by his dean and the president.\nCourse numbers will be kept under the\n100 level (graduate) whenever possible.\nNew course titles will be created in\norder to avoid confusion with present\ncredit courses. Courses meeting three\ntimes (three one-half periods) each week\non television will offer two hours credit;\ncourses meeting twice each week on tele¬\nvision will offer one hour credit.\n• A TV COURSE being taught\nfor the first time will consume more\nof the instructor’s time than a\ncampus course, even though he has\ntaught the course on campus many\ntimes. Course materials must be\nreorganized and even condensed,\ngeared to a time schedule, and the\npresentation punctuated with ap¬\npropriate visual aids. Regular re¬\nhearsals must be conducted for each\nbroadcast, and time must be allowed\nto travel to and from the TV sta¬\ntion.\nInquiries of officials of other uni¬\nversities with TV experience indi¬\ncated that, in general, faculty mem¬\nbers were being given two hours\ncredit on their teaching load for\neach hour they appeared on televi¬\nsion. This allowance is probably\nContinued, from page 16\nentirely adequate once the TV\ncourse is organized and is being re¬\npeated, but there is doubt as to\nwhether it is a fair allowance when\nfaculty members are offering\ncourses for the first time.\n• STUDY GUIDES include in¬\nstructions on viewing the courses,\ncourse descriptions, outline of top¬\nics, daily lesson assignments, auxi¬\nliary and regular reading assign¬\nments, information on arranging\nconferences with the instructor, and\ntechniques of note taking. These\nmust be prepared and printed with\ngreat care well in advance of be¬\nginning each course. The study\nguide bridges the gap between in¬\nstructor and student resulting from\nnot being together in a classroom\nand not meeting frequently for con¬\nferences. Illustrative materials and\naudio visual aids to be used when\nbroadcasting are needed to contri¬\nbute to understanding of subject\nmatter and to hold the interest of\nviewers. These include: maps,\ncharts, diagrams, blackboard, slides,\nfilms, models, books, pamphlets,\nand records.\n• THE ACADEMIC administra¬\ntion of courses offered via TV\nshould remain the responsibility of\nthe dean and department head in\ncharge of the subject matter offer¬\ned.
