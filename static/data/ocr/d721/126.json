This head as¬\nsembly has four small magnetic\nheads located at 90° intervals about\na small rotating disc, and gives an\neffective tape speed sufficient to\nrecord and reproduce all of the\nvideo electrical signals in the tele¬\nvision picture. The sound that ac¬\ncompanies the television picture is\nrecorded in the same way as on a\nconventional recorder. The sound\ntrack runs along the edge of the\nmagnetic tape and insures that\nsound and picture are always in\nperfect synchronization.\nRewind time for the full reel is\nless than three minutes, and the\nmachine can be stopped in approxi¬\nmately the time it takes for about\ntwo inches of tape to be pulled past\nthe head. Picture resolution and de¬\ntail achieved with the Videotape\nRecorder is far beyond the cap¬\nabilities of the average home tele¬\nvision receiver, and individual tapes\nhave been rerun as many as 100\ntimes without losing quality.\nOnce the Recorder has been ad¬\njusted, operation is a simple matter\nof pushing a few buttons, and re¬\ncordings are ready for playback im¬\nmediately after rewind without any\nprocessing involved. Gray scale re¬\nproduction characteristics are iden¬\ntical to that obtained with television\ncameras on a live show, and are\nsuperior to results obtained from\neven the best kinescopes.\n• ADVANTAGES FOR THE\nTV INDUSTRY:—CBS News\nfilm is exploring the possibilities of\norganizing a national newsreel ser¬\nvice that would transmit newsfilm\non the coaxial cables connecting\ntheir affiliates during off hours\nwhen the cables must kept\n“hot” anyway. A subscriber to this\nservice would use the Videotape\nRecorder to store the program for\nsubsequent telecasting according to\nlocal programming schedules. This\nsame type of delayed broadcast is\nbeing discussed as the answer to the\nimportant problem of originating\nEast Coast programs for viewing by\nWest Coast audiences despite the\ntime difference involvement.\nThe ability to erase the magnetic\ntape after a delayed program has\nbeen played back into the network,\nand then to reuse the same tape to\nrecord a different program is a\nvital factor in reducing annual\ncosts. Another money-saving ap¬\nplication would be to cut production\ncosts by using a single-shift studio\ncrew and recording all live shows\non tape during their working hours.\nThe programs could be played back\nlater from the Videotape Recorder\nto coincide with programming times.\nThe re-running of finishes of\nraces, K. O.’s in fights, and thrill¬\ning climaxes of football and baseball\ngames lend themselves readily to\nthe capabilities of this versatile re¬\ncorder. Similarly, the Videotape de¬\nvice can be installed in mobile\ntrucks for use with cameras for\nspecial events pickups which can¬\nnot be easily microwaved back to\nthe station, or which occur un¬\nexpectedly and do not allow time to\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
