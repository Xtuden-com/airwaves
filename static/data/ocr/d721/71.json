Messy or\nno, 'I was gratified to see the number of returns that\n3\n1\nme; back - acceptances on the little \"ribbon” at the\nottcm of the page, or sincere regrets from those who\ncouldnt come but took the time to write and say so.\nSince Vee will be doing the heaviest billing in March\nfar April (and possibly May dues) plus all the back¬\nsliders, its an excellent chance to reach a lot of our\n^ members with just one mailing. You no doubt have\n1 0 thought of something much better but I*m passing this\nalong for what it may be worth.\nGertrude\nBy the way, do you know my old fri^ndf Reg Coggeshall,\nwho is on the BU faculty? I knew him jjrears back at\nthe U. of Minn."
