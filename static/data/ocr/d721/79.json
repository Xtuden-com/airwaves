Then might\ncome Mickey Mouse, America’s\nSymbol of the World, Disneyland,\nCaptain Kangaroo, Lassie, Cap¬\ntain Video, the Space Soldiers,\nHans Christian Anderson, the Ad¬\nventures of Robin Hood, Rin Tin\nTin, the Westerns, Roy Rogers,\nLone Ranger, and even Howdy\nDoody! This is what they are of¬\nfered.\nHow does our criteria apply to\nthem?\nThen, for the older children\n(9-13):—Mr. Wizard, Zoo Parade,\nLassie, Mama, Father Knows Best,\nLets’ take a Trip! Captain Gallant,\nRamar of the Jungle, Rin Tin Tin\n(again), Hopalong Cassidy, Hans\nChristian Anderson (again), Robin\nHood, Swiss Family Robinson, and\nsports like baseball, football, and\nbasketball.\nWhat happens to our criteria\nhere?\nThen for high school: Youth\nWants to Know, Teen Age Trials,\nAdventure, Navy Log, Halls of Ivy,\nYou Are There! See It Now! Wide,\nWide, World, College Press Con¬\nferences, I Search for Adventure,\nMeet the Press, Peter Pan, Bar¬\nrie’s ‘Old Lady Shows Her Med¬\nals’, Richard III, Hamlet, Taming\nof the Shrew,” and much more\nShakespeare — Frank Baxter, for\nexample—and, of course, sports,\nbaseball, football, basketball, and\nboxing.\nNow for /college youth (17-21):\nThis is practically adult fare. Ad¬\nventure, You Are There!. See It\nNow, Wide, Wide World, Navy\nLog, Halls of Ivy, College Press\nConference, Meet the Press, Face\nthe Nation, the Spectaculars (all of\nthem!), Producer’s Show Case and\nmany other free dramatic offerings.\nAdd Frontiers of Faith, Lamp Unto\nMy Feet, Life Is Worth Living, and\nLook Up and Live, and the quiz\nshows like “What’s My Line? I’ve\nGot a Secret, and, I suppose, the\ngive-aways like “The Big Surprise,\nor The $64,000 Question.\nWould our criteria apply? I can’t\nmake these decisions for anyone.\nI don’t suppose you can either; but\nboth of us can establish levels of\nfact and discrimination that sort\n. . . should give a\nspiritual lift.\nout the best from the less wor¬\nthy, and the less worthy from the\ntawdry or mediocre. I don’t think\nyou can deal with the problem from\nthe standpoint of television alone.\nI never knew an artist who did\nnot recognize the essential values\nNOVEMBER 195(5"
