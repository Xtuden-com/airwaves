A closed-circuit\nsystem with viewing monitors al¬\nlowed the group to see itself on\ncamera. Simultaneously, the same\nimages were being magnetically im¬\npressed on an Ampex Videotape\nRecorder. Playback of this taped\nrecord was intermixed with live\npickup reproduction to permit close\ncomparison of their relative fidelity.\nAs a result of these trials and\nothers of a similar nature at later\ndates, enthusiastic comment was ex¬\npressed by both technical and man¬\nagement executives over the sim¬\nplicity of operation and the quality\nof reproduction of the machine\nunder widely varying lighting and\nprogramming conditions.\n• HOW IT WORKSThe con¬\nsole model illustrated looks like an\novergrown version of the regular\naudio tape recorder, but incorpor¬\nates many ingenious innovations.\nThe tape employed has a Mylar\nbase .001 in thickness, is two inches\nin width, and 12%\" reel of this\nmaterial (4800 ft.) pulled at a speed\nof 15 inches per second will record\nor play back 64 minutes of material.\nThe device that makes quality re¬\ncording possible at this compara¬\ntively low tape speed where a re-\nFEBRUARY 1957\n19"
