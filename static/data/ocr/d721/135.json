At the same\ntime there would be a nominal in¬\ncrease in the operational expense be¬\ncause of additional power consump¬\ntion and increased tube replace¬\nments costs.\nOn a comparative basis, the pop¬\nulation served by the 100-watt and\n500-watt station were determined\nto be as follows:\n100 WATTS\nWithin Grade A\n47,865\nWithin Grade B\n22,441\nTotal served\n70,306\n500 WATTS\nWithin Grade A\n55,932\nWithin Grade B\n26,796\nTotal served\n82,728\nAlthough these population figures\ndo not compare favorably with\nthose of commercial TV stations,\nthey are definitely encouraging, and\ncertainly large enough to justify the\nexistence of the educational station.\n• IN CONCLUSION, the ad¬\nvent of low-power telecasting\nequipment offers educators an un¬\nusual opportunity to construct and\noperate their own educational TV\nstation for a surprisingly modest\noriginal investment, a figure com¬\nparable with the cost of a modem,\nwell-equipped classroom. At the\nsame time, since the transmitter and\naccessory equipment use c o m-\nparatively inexpensive tubes oper¬\nated at conservative voltages and\ncurrents, operational costs are only\nmoderately higher than those of a\nstandard educational FM broadcast\nstation.\nCertainly America’s educators\nshould be giving immediate con¬\nsideration to the construction and\noperation of such a low-power sta¬\ntion on their locally reserved chan¬\nnel. Once the station is on the air\nand the staff trained, attention can\nbe given to improving the studio\nfacilities, expanding the program\nschedule, and extending the station’s\ncoverage through increased power.\nMeanwhile, education has staked\nits claim to one more of those in¬\nvaluable television channels.\nFEBRUARY 1957\n29"
