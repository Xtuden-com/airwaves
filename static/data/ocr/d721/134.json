(Now, television)\nplaces the people behind the sets\n... in the studios ... in a position\nof great responsibility because, how¬\never unimportant the individual\nprogramme may seem to them, the\nimpact on their audience is tremen¬\ndous and the possible results in¬\ncalculable. I say ‘however unim¬\nportant’ because, in the hurlyburly\nof television production, it is some¬\ntimes very difficult to remember\nthese facts. For people working in\ntelevision the fact that the pro¬\ngramme goes on at all is often such\na miracle that the end product is\nforgotten. I do not defend this\nstate of affairs but must recognize\nits existence.” (Pp. 83-84)\nFrom the Chapter: Criticism in\nTelevision,” by Peter Black (TV\nand radio critic, London Daily\nMail)\n“I suggested earlier that the tele¬\nvision critic has consolations for\nhis lonely and peculiar life. It is\ntrue that, compared with his col¬\nleagues of the theatre and cinema,\nhe appears to have little influence\nand less power. But the job of a\ncritic does not end with these. There\nis also the obligation to reflect, sus¬\ntain, and increase interest in what¬\never medium he is writing about.\nIt must be obvious that here the\ntelevision critic can have great po¬\ntential influence . . . The oppor¬\ntunities open to a television critic\nare in direct proportion to the enor¬\nmous public interest in television.\nTo argue that, because television\nprogrammes are fleeting, criticism\nis useless, is to pick up the stick\nby the wrong end. It is because\ntelevision is fleeting that criticism\nis so important ... It is important\nthat programme producers, who are\nworking for the public, should\nhave their work acknowledged.\n. . . The obligation to be construc¬\ntive is pressing. Critics of other\nentertainment are recommending\ntheir readers to buy it or to leave\nit alone . . . The television critic\nhas to go further and describe how,\nin his opinion, a programme could\nhave been made better . . . There\nare two ways for a critic to keep\non friendly terms with the read¬\ners who pay his salary. The danger¬\nous way is to try to get inside their\nminds and flatter their judgment\nby agreeing with it. The other, and\nsafer, is to pay them the compli¬\nment of honest thought . .
