Tt is\nthe first TV survey in which the\ndiary system was used for record¬\ning the pupils’ televiewing habits.\n® THE FIRST part of the survey\nrevealed some 6,000 pupils enrolled\nin the 16 schools in the city and\nof this number 34 per cent had TV\nreceivers in the home. Of this 34\nper cent having sets, 59 per cent\nhad them for six months or longer,\nwith an average of 16 months set\nownership.\nEach boy and girl who had had a\ntelevision set for six months or\nlonger was given a seven-day diary\nto take home. The diary was de¬\nsigned after the CBS Listener Diary\nmentioned earlier. Each pupil was\nasked to record all TV viewing for\nevery 15 minutes he was watching\nprograms. Also he was asked to\nrecord the number of persons view¬\ning with him. This method of\nrecording produced a record of the\nactual number of minutes and hours\neach boy and girl spent televiewing\neach day for one week, Monday\nthrough Sunday. A complete re¬\ncord of all programs televiewed\nwas also established. Excellent co¬\noperation of parents resulted in a\nreturn of 1887 completed diaries,\nor 79 per cent of all diaries given\nout.\nThe diaries provided an accurate\nrecord of the time patterns of tele¬\nviewing for each pupil for each\nday, the types of programs viewed,\nprogram popularity with the view¬\ners, and the size and composition\nof the audience viewing the pro¬\ngram in each home. The diaries\nwere kept by the children during a\nso-called typical week. All four\nmajor network systems fed their\nprograms to this area in which re¬\nception was relatively good. During\nthe week, although telecasting began\nat 1:00 p.m., children did not get\nout of school until 3:30 p.m. and\ncould not begin their televiewing\nuntil about 4:00 p.m. This gave\nthem eight hours of available view¬\ning time between 4:00 p.m. and\nmidnight, 14 hours of available\nviewing time on Saturday, and\nSunday offered 12 hours.\nTo complete the study each boy\nand girl who had returned a diary\nwas interviewed by the author or\nhis assistants. Each pupil gave\nanswers to a complete and compre¬\nhensive questionnaire.\nThe investigator believes the re¬\nliability of the majority of respon¬\nses was increased in view of certain\nfacts: (1) a high percentage of\nthe diaries were returned; (2) the\ntype of information desired did not\naffect the status of the boy or girl\nNew TV owners\nare atypical.\nin school; (3) the interviews were\nobtained easily because of the ex¬\ncellent attitude of cooperation by\nthose involved in the study; (4)\nthe methods employed were some¬\nwhat standardized; (5) the group\ninvolved was large enough and com¬\nposed only of those who had had\ntelevision long enough to show what\neffects, if any, the medium was\nContinued on page 25\n12\nThe AERT JOURNAL"
