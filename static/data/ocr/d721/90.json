  "text": "classroom teachers must adapt\ntheir material to TV. The subject\nmatter of courses must be organized\nto be concise, clearly stated, in¬\nteresting, and timed to the program\nschedule. Moreover, the TV au¬\ndience, even though registered for\na course, is not a captive one, and\nthe standards of performance are\nbased on comparisons with ex¬\nperienced actors and programs\nwhich are rehearsed to the point of\nperfection.\nFaculty members at T.U. were\napproached on the idea of offering\ncourses via television with a clear\nunderstanding that by accepting\nthey agreed to regular rehearsals at\nwhich there would be criticisms of\nspeech, techniques of instruction,\ndress, appearance, and mannerisms.\nPhotoreflex Studio\nDr. Asa S. Knowles\nSeveral faculty members responded\nwhole-heartedly. One faculty mem¬\nber after teaching TV courses with\ngreat success suggested that every\ninstructor should be required to\nteach at least one TV course. “If\nfor no other reason,” he stated,\n“the subject matter of his course\nwould take on a different aspect\nwhen looked at from the standpoint\nof presenting it before an audience\nof 20,000.”\n* IF COURSE CREDITS earned\nby taking courses via TV are to be\nof value, they must have faculty\napproval. A careful study of this\nproblem by a special committee re¬\nsulted in the adoption of regulations\nby the University faculty which\nwere designed to assure mainten¬\nance of proper academic standards.\nThese regulations follow:\nEach telecourse has two methods of reg¬\nistration : 1) Persons enrolling for cred¬\nit will receive a copy of the syllabus,\nwritten assignments and come to the Uni¬\nversity to take a final examination. Per¬\nsons enrolling as auditors will receive\na copy of the syllabus and written as¬\nsignments. The textbooks for a tele¬\ncourse will be required reading and dis¬\ntributed to viewers by the University\nBookstore; 2) Persons who desire the\nsyllabus may obtain it at a cost to be\ndetermined.\nThe instructor will prepare the syllabus,\nwritten assignments, and the final exam¬\nination. He will also read and grade\nthe completed assignments and examina¬\ntion, the latter to be given on the camp¬\nus. The Evening Sessions Office will be\nresponsible for mailing out syllabi and\nthe assignments. This office will also\ntransmit assignments completed by the\nstudents to the instructor and and re¬\nturn the graded work to the students.\nThis office will handle all registration\ndetails.\nThe instructor will plan the presenta¬\ntion of each program with the director\nof radio and TV programming.
