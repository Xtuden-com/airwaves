The nature of\nthese responsibilities is directly in\nline with work done ordinarily by\ndirectors of evening sessions, adult\neducation, and extension courses. At\nthe University of Toledo, these ad¬\nministrative aspects are the respon¬\nsibility of the director of evening\nsessions.\n• A UNIVERSITY undertaking\na TV program must be aware of\npossible adverse public reaction to\nthe faculty’s competence and to the\nuniversity itself if courses are not\nwell received. An attempt can be\nmade to meet this problem by seeing\nto it that no one is allowed to go on\nthe air until his or her presentation\nis made as perfect as can be ex¬\npected under the conditions. There\nis some question, too, as to whether\noffering TV courses may diminish\nthe numbers entering the regular\ncourse offerings for adults. T.U.’s\nexperience is that more interest has\nbeen aroused in university course\nofferings, thereby expanding the\nservice of the institution to the com¬\nmunity.\nThe initial response to T.U.-Tele¬\nstudy at the University of Toledo\nexceeded expectations. Over 150\nstudents paid for registration and\nstudy guides in the first semester\nand over 325 registered and bought\nstudy guides in the second semester.\nThe viewing audiences were esti¬\nmated at 20,000- Those who re¬\ngistered tended to be older people.\nT.U.’s oldest TV student was a 76-\nyear-old woman. Despite this, how¬\never, it was found that those taking\nthe courses for credit not only did\nbetter work than students enrolled\nin regular classes, but also did more\noutside reading.\nExperience in offering courses\nfor credit by educational TV has\nresulted in a development which\nother institutions report to have\nexperienced also. As the courses\nbecome more frequent and better\nknown, it is believed that more and\nmore viewers watch the course pre¬\nsentation but fewer undertake to\nregister for credit. Apparently\nmany persons find that they can\nprofit a great deal from the\ncourses even though they do not\nattempt to read the text and follow\nthe study guides. Perhaps only\nthose who need college credit will\nfind it worthwhile to pay registra¬\ntion fees and costs of guides and\ntexts.\nA most valuable by-product is\nthat faculty members teaching TV\ncourses review and reappraise the\nTHE COMMON STOCK of intellectual enjoyment\nshould not be difficult of access because of the economic\nposition of him who would approach it.\n—Jane Adams\nNOVEMBER 1956\n23"
