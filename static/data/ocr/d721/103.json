At first, reading was inter¬\nfered with to a very great degree.\nHowever, the majority readily ad¬\nmitted their reading habits had re¬\nturned to the original pattern.\nSome also indicated that teleview¬\ning had stimulated their reading in-\nParen+s, teachers\nmust guide carefully.\nterests by offering new subjects,\nor that they were motivated to read\nmore about something they had seen\non TV.\n18. Eighty-one per cent of all\nboys and girls in all grades empha¬\ntically pointed out that television\ndid not interfere with doing home¬\nwork. They qualified this feeling\nby expressing the ways in which\nthey did homework and at the same\ntime televiewed the programs they\nliked. They also pointed out that\ntheir grades were considerably\nabove average. We must remember\nthese boys and girls had set patterns\nof televiewing which they followed\nclosely, and could allot their time\nfor other things rather easily.\n19. Seventy per cent reported\ntelevision did not interfere with\ntheir hobbies. Some contended it\nhad increased their interest in a\nhobby. A small percentage (7) in¬\ndicated television interfered enough\nto cause them to drop the hobby.\n20. It was found that 49 per\ncent of the students in grades four\nthrough 12 participated in some 40\ndifferent extra-curricular activities\nconnected with the schools. They\nreported that televiewing did not\ninterfere with these activities.\n21. Movie attendance dropped\noff tremendously at first; however,\n75 per cent indicated it had returned\nto the original pattern in approxi¬\nmately nine months.\n22. In television programs they\nview, in books they read, in movies\nthey see, and in radio programs they\nlisten to, these children wanted\nvariety and a relationship of con¬\ntent which would give them a cer¬\ntain breadth of knowledge and\nunderstanding as well as pleasure.\n23. Most of the students readily\nadmitted that when their television\nsets were new, their televiewing in¬\nterfered with almost everything:\nreading, movie attendance, dancing,\ndates, playing after school, and\nextra - curricular activities. Now\nwhen the newness had worn thin,\n89 per cent reported TV did not\ninterfere with these activities.\nEducators should make every\neffort to use the medium of tele¬\nvision as a part of their program\nof education. Teachers and parents\nalike should be alert to what is be¬\ning telecast and then encourage\nchildren to view worthwhile pro¬\ngrams. Proper guidance by teach¬\ners and parents in the use of home\nteleviewing time can help supple¬\nment education. Both the home\nand the school must give children\nnumerous and successful ex¬\nperiences that will satisfy interests\nand needs. Parent and teacher\nmust guide children patiently and\ncarefully, if television is to be used\neffectively in promoting the growth\nof a broad background of education\nfor children.\nNOVEMBER 1956\n29"
