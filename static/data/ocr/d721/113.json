Braum, Engi-\neering Consultant for the Joint\nCouncil on Educational Television,\ntitled “Low Cost Educational Sta¬\ntions,” the limits of the various ser¬\nvice contours were determined.\nThe service contours were then\ntraced on two maps, the topographic\nmap of the Eugene quadrangle and\nthe minor civil subdivisions map of\nthe same area. This is the same pro¬\ncedure required by the FCC in pre¬\nparing engineering exhibits for an\napplication for construction permit\nfor a new station.\nTo determine the effect on cover¬\nage of a sizeable increase in power,\nsimilar service contours were drawn\non the same maps, assuming an ef¬\nfective radiated power of 500 watts.\nUsing data from the 1950 census,\nthe population within each service\ncontour was then determined on a\nprecinct by precinct basis.\nReferring to the service contours\non the topographic map, it will be\nnoted that with 100 watts of ef¬\nfective radiated power the Grade A\ncontour extends to a radius of 2\nmiles from the transmitter, and the\nGrade B contour to a radius of 5\nmiles. Increasing the effective\nradiated power to 500 watts in¬\ncreases the radius of the Grade A\ncontour to 3.2 miles, and that of the\nGrade B contour to 7.7 miles. It\ncan be safely assumed that any\nviewer within the limits of the\nGrade B contours will receive very\nacceptable service.\nAlso, since the FCC propagation\ndata were compiled several years\nRoger J. Houglum\nago when TV receivers were far\nless sensitive and stable than they\nare today, there is every reason to\nbelieve that there will be a sub¬\nstantial number of viewers receiving\nsatisfactory service well beyond the\nlimits of the Grade B contour, par¬\nticularly if they have a modern\nreceiver and an effective antenna.\n• AT PRESENT, there is no\nspecific information available as to\nthe additional cost of increasing the\neffective radiated power from 100\nto 500 watts. This could be ac¬\ncomplished either by installing a\nContinued on page 29\nFEBRUARY 1957"
