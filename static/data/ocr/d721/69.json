MICHIGAN\nMarch 3, 1956\nTo Loo Martin and Keith Tyler?\nDear Gentst\nForgive the use of carbon copies, but time is of the essence, and my\ntyping seems to get no better and no faster* This, in any event, is just\na britff note to tell you about the enclosed tentative program.\nEd Stanley has agreed to be our luncheon speaker, and Ifm following\npast programs in having Leo give the address of welcome at the morning\nsession, with Past ^resident presiding as hostess at the luncheon.\n1 haven*t scheduled a formal address for the afternoon session on Closed\nCircuit TV, but will give about a 5-minute introduction myself, stressing\nthe impotence of the FAE experiments for all of us. Hie omission of a 40-\nminute speaker is to leave time for exceprts from kinescopes if the FM\npanelists bring kines, as I am asking them to do. 1 also suspect there\nwill be quite a bit of questioning from the floor from people who want\nto know partlcSLars about the closed circuit experiments.\nA thiafcd carbon has gone to Gertrude, who will write you both directly at\nthe same time that she informs me which 6f the asterisked participants\nhave come through since she last wrote me. Dorothy Klock isn’t sure that\nshe’ll be coming out to Columbus, so wo have Arlene McKellar standing by\nto chair the morning panel if need be.\nForgive the hefete, the carbons, and the bad\ntyping.\nCheerio „ »\nEDWARD STASHEFf\nLEO:\nGertrude reminded me a month ago to get your approval of the\n9:00 A.M. Coffee Hour. It has set the AERT Treasure back between 12 and\n15 bucks in the past, but has been qiite successful. Will you approve the\nexpenditure this year? If not, please write Keith pronto to take that\nitem out of the program. Sorry it slipped my mind."
