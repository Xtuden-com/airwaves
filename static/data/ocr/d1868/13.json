Interest¬\ning highlights in the life of each\ncomposer will be presented, with\nsome emphasis on their most im¬\nportant contributions to music\nform. These men and their con¬\ntributions will be presented in\nchronological order. Recorded il¬\nlustrations of their compositions\nwill be played by outstanding\nartists.\nThe percentage of students\nwhose homes are equipped with\na phonograph and a collection of\nclassical records is small. Thus\nthe only way most young people\ncome in contact with the classics is\nthrough radio. During the broad¬\ncast, information will be given\nconcerning other WBAA programs\nthat use classical music. This in¬\nformation will cover the time of\nbroadcasting and the announce¬\nment of the selections that will be\nperformed. This is done in the\nhope that interest in classical\nmusic will be aroused among the\nstudents.\nA manual for teachers has been\nprepared which will aid the in¬\nstructor in preparing the class for\nthe broadcast. The program was\nprepared and will be presented\nby Mrs. Jo Bundy Haniford,\nJo Haniford\nWBAA's music director. Mrs.\nHaniford is a graduate of the De-\nPauw University School of Music\nand a former member of the music\nfaculty of the City Schools of An¬\nderson, Indiana.\nSCHEDULE\nSeptember\n20 Johann Sebastian Bach\n27 George Frederic Handel\nOctober\n4 Franz Josef Haydn\n11 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n18 Ludwig van Beethoven\n25 No Broadcast (Teachers' Convention)\nNovember\n1 Franz Peter Schubert\n8 Robert Schumann\n15 Frederic Chopin\n22 Richard Wagner\n29 No Broadcast (Thanksgiving)\nDecember\n6 Johannes Brahms\n13 Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel\n— 14 —"
