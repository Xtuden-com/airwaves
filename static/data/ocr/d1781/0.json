The application should be\naccompanied by a full description of the exact means proposed to accomplish the change\nin power. After review of the application, it will be determined whether the proposed\nchange may be authorized by a mere modification of license or, because of modification\nof existing circuitry or elimination of certain transmitter stages, a construction\npermit will be issued*\nWhere a construction permit is issued authorizing the change, a license\napplication on FCC Form 302 to cover the construction permit must ultimately be filed.\nSuch license applications will noimally require new performance measurements, but only\non the aural portion of the station facilities.\nInformal requests for special temporary authority to operate with reduced\naural power will be considered where a station wants to experimentally determine the\nexact reduced aural power level best suited for its individual service area require-\nments.
