The August is¬\nsue will be written at NAEB headquarters\nin Washington.\nI would like to thank all of you who\nhave helped by sending me news of your ac¬\ntivities through the years, and I know your\ncontinued cooperation, will be appreciated\nby the new editor. In addition to sending\nfuture information for the Newsletter to\nWashington, I hope you will still send to\nme in Urbana, for the time being, anything\nthat might be of interest to the NAEB Jour¬\nnal.\nLooking back through old Newsletter\nprint orders, I find that the number printed\ntoday is almost triple what it was when I\ncame seven years ago. Even that doesn’t ac¬\ncurately reflect the growth, however, be¬\ncause in those days institutional members\ncould receive up to three copies each; now\nthey receive one.\nWhile reminiscing about NAEB’s growth,\nI might mention that in July, 1959, there\nwere 43 ETV stations instead of the 111 or\nso of today, and NAEB had under 500 In¬\ndividual Members. Now there are about\n2250. The entire NAEB staff numbered 12\nin 1959, whereas now there are 30 or so in\nWashington and 8 in Urbana.\n—BMcK.\nAbout UNICEF\nNAEBers who might want to begin early\nto plan tie-ins with UNICEF’s Halloween\nTrick or Treat program may obtain infor¬\nmation from: U.
