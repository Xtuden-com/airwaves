  "text": "6\nnational groups about this proceeding and urging them to prepare\naccordingly. NEA held a national conference of outstanding leaders in\neducation, government, labor, industry to discuss this matter (June 2 0th).\nch&O*-\nNAEB, using the same date which the FCC staff will have from our computer\nstudy, but employing different criteria, will prepare its own national\nallocations plan. Many organizations are planning to file written comments\nand, if efforts to procure an oral hearing are successful, the^will have\nrepresentatives testify. Of particular importance will be filings from all communi¬\nties where there are indications of need for multiple reservations.\nAs soon as the FCC plan is announced we urge all of you to give it close\nstudy to determine whether it satisfies the needs of your community for its ETV potential\nand then prepare to act accordingly.\nFinally, this is the time for a Thomas Jefferson to step forward. We\nneed a new Declaration of the true public interest in Broadcasting; a stirring\nassertion of values in the allocation of precious resources couched in\nterms so logical and lucid ‘as to compel acceptance.1 Now is the time\nfor the definitive statement of the imperative need for our society to\nsecure for its own benefit adequate means for maximizing the extension of\neducational and cultural opportunities to all.\nUnless such provision is made now in the allocation and reservation of\nfrequencies for non-commercial use, television may never be projected into\nthe full usefulness of which it is capable in the service of education and\nour society."
