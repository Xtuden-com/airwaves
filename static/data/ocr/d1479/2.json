S. Department of Agriculture\nand WET A, Washington. Emphasis is on\nhome study and correspondence aspects,\nand the TV programs provide clarification.\nAfter its current use in Washington, the\ncourse will be available to educational and\ncommercial stations throughout the coun¬\ntry.\n^ WQED, Pittsburgh, has announced an\nincrease of 54,390 students receiving ITV\nthis year over last year. Rhea Sikes, direc¬\ntor of school services, cited several reasons\nfor the increase: WQED’s switch to maxi¬\nmum power in December 1964, the growth\nof cable companies, and the initiative of a\ngroup of educators in one county who\nwanted ITV, and installed a $15,000 trans¬\nlator.\n^ A new CCTV system links the Univer¬\nsity of Texas law school with five district\ncourtrooms, and feeds trial proceedings in¬\nto a special TV room on the campus. This\nis believed to be the first such installation\nin the South or Southwest; law schools at\nthe universities of Michigan and Minneso¬\nta already have similar hookups.\nGENERAL\n^ WQED, Pittsburgh, will undertake a 5\nmillion dollar project for construction of\na new building and for program and per¬\nsonnel development.
