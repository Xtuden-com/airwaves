The commercial\nstation involved, however, had strong representation in Washington.\nIt protested, and the second identical application was denied by the\nsame commissloner*\nThrough the years, such cases have occurred and the story\nhas ended there. In this instance, however. Station W0I had direct\nWashington advice available, learned (what it had. not known) .that it\nhad a legal right to appeal to the full Commission, appealed in\ngood form, and got the additional hours to which it was entitled.\nThis incident can be multiplied a dozen times a year, and with the\ngrowth of educational FM, it can be repeated a hundred times a year.\nOperating a radio station without Washington representation is almost\nlike operating without an engineer or announcer*\n4, Encouraging Bew Applications. The first step in es¬\ntablishing an American system, of educational broadcasting was getting\nthe channels® The second step is building the stations• In this\nsecond step, a strong organisation of educational FM interests is\nessential*\nAs of March , 1946, only six noncommercial educational FM\nbroadcast stations are on the air, an additional have been au¬\nthorized by the F.C.C., and additional applications are pending.\nA reasonable goal is 500 educational stations on the air.
