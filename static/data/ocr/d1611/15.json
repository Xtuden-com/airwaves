  "text": "He PLAN FOR AN ORGANIZATION OF NONCOMMERCIAL\nEDUCATIONAL FM BROADCAST STATIONS\nThis memorandum seeks to outline some considerations involved\nin establishing an organization powerful enough to tackle the tasks\nset forth in Memorandum I.\nlaâ€”TM.,_prop,osed. organlzation,should be independent. It should\nnot be an appendage of either the F.C.C. or the U.S. Office of Education*\nIt must be free to help or to prod or to criticise those agencies,\nas the situation demands.\nIt should not be financed directly or indirectly by commercial\nbroadcast interests. It should maintain the friendliest relationship\nwith commercial interests as a basic principle, but it should deal\nwith commercial broadcasting at arm's length, speaking out as\nspecifically for educational interests as the National Association of\nBroadcasters speaks for commercial interests, without any inner conflict\nwithin the educational organization, its independence will be especially\nimportant in the event that concerted efforts are made to break down the\nreservation of 20 FM channels for educational use. The mere existence\nof a strong educational FM organization, indeed, may be sufficient to\nprevent attack on this reservation.\nIt should be distinct and separate from organizations whose primary\ninterest is educational programs on commercial stations* Such organizations\nperform an extremely Important function. It is a different function,\nhowever, from representing and assisting educational institutions which\nare themselves the licensees of broadcast stations*\n2a The proposed organization should be open to (a) educational\nInstitutions which now operate standard non-commercial broadcast stations,"
