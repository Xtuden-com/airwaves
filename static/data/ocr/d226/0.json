Silverstonc\nDirector, Audio-Visual Center and\nAssociate Professor of Education\nUniversity of Bridgeport\nBridgeport 4, Connecticut\nDear Dr. SiIvorstone:\nHarold Hill has forwarded to me your letter of December 14th. The only\nsuggestion which I would have for funds to do what you propose would be the\nU* S, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, (I am assuming here that\nyou have a research proposal, and not merely a proposal for the development\nof a teaching method.) The Cooperative Research Branch of the Department of\nEducation supports virtually any kind of good educational research. The New\nMedia branch of the Department will support any good research which appears\nto have important implications for better utilization of any of the newer\nmedia of education. This would include radio, recordings, television, films,\netc. I would suggest that you write to these offices for details on their\nprograms.\nI hope that this is the sort, of information which you want.\nSincerely,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Fi Ira\nSLB:mw\ncc: Harold E, Hill\nP. S. By the way, I obviously do not know what your proposal is but it seems\nto me that sane very good research has been done on listening since 1930.\nThe problem is that it is not always labeled as \"listening.\" Actually,\nany of the research on factors affecting retention, evaluation, etc., by\nmy definition, fall into the category of \"listening\" research."
