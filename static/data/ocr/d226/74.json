It is\nestimated that 42% of the population have either radio or television turned on between\n5:30 and 6:30 PM and this figure jumps to 56% between 7:30 and 8:30. The 1956 survey\nderived similar results except that the 1956 results showed lower percentages: 37% at\nthe 5:30 hour, and 47% at the 7:30 hour. These comparisons will be discussed in a\nfollowing section.\nThe share of audience held by WBAA is presented in Table 11.\nOf interest is the fact that, contrary to the share of audience figures of all other\nradio stations received in the Lafayette area, WBAA's share of audience figure remains\nfairly stable during the evening hours, while other stations diminish in their share of\nthe audience. During the hour starting at 5:30, WBAA had 4.1% of the audience and\nduring the hour starting at 7:30, WBAA had 4. 5% of the audience. WBAA apparently\nreceives more listeners in proportion as the total audience increases, so in effect\nmore persons tune to WBAA as the evening progresses, but not enough to appreciably\nincrease WBAA's share of the audience."
