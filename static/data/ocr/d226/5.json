We tried to place them in the\nhands of stations and departments rxgkfe just after the opening\nof the academic year. As Irv Merrill has indicated, if any of\nyou have ideas £>nr the improvement of iat&xs; this grants program,\nplease offer them.\nEqually important, we would appreciate any suggestions which\nyou have for ways in whicji you feel our committee might\nhscfefeEK serve educational broadcasting or broadcast research.\nThis is not to say that I think we ought to 10bk for something\nto do to keep busy, simply because someone has designated us\nas a committee.(I am certain that none of you needjadditional\nsuggestions for ways to keep busy.) However, if #here is a\nneed which we might fill, I think that it should be considered\nby the committee. The NAEB currently has two or three proposals\nbefore the Department of Health, Education, and\nWelfare (undei^itle VET of the Hill-Elliot Bill). If one or\nmore of these goes through, there will\ncertainly be a need for advice and assistance of members of the\nresearch committee.\n•ferhf.v ic y kbfBt'TTOyanygry\nI am looking forward to hearing from you.\nBest\nSamuel L.
