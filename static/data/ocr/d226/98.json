The question, \"How many people were listening?” should be eliminated.\nThe information is subject to a judgment by the interviewee as to what age children\nshould be included in the number provided to the interviewer. Second, the informa¬\ntion was intended to develop a listenership ratio to each set in use and, as such, adds\nlittle to the total information of the survey. If this question were eliminated, each\ninterviewer might attempt 25 to 30 calls for each fifteen minute period, rather than\n20 calls. This would add to the reliability of the shorter periods of listenership by\nincreasing the sample size, which is itself more important than a listenership ratio."
