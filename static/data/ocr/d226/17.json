I\nsuggest that Bedwell submit his proposal to the WAB or to the APBE.\nOf the remaining three proposals Errar* s appears to be best\norganised and most clearly expressed; I would award it $Â£00,\nAlthough the proposals by Hickman and by Brown are not well stated,\nI would award Hickman $200 and Brown $100 as token expression of\nthe Association*g interest in supporting research in both closed\ncircuit (community antenna) television and radio.\nMy warmest personal wishes to you.\nCordially,\nKenneth Harwood, Chairman\nDepartment of Tele ooraraurd cations\nair mail\nSamuel Be deer\nHarry Skornia"
