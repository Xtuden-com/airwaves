Problem Of The Study; First, to isolate and define those\ncharacteristics that are believed to be found in a higher degree\namong opinion leaders than among the population as a whole* Then,\nto design and execute questionnaires that will provide a reliable\nand valid measure of the probable prestige and social influence of\na sample of the known audience of KUOW as compared to a similar\nnumber of respondents randomly sampled from the population as a whole*\n4* Relationship To Existing Studies: While many studies of\nthe educational radio audience have measured the socio-economic\nstatus of that audience, the applicant finds none that have been\noriented primarily toward an analysis of the prestige and influence\nof its individual members. The findings of this study should\nsupplement existing knowledge of the composition of the educational\nradio audience and its influence in the community.\n5* Sources of Data, Materials, and Procedures: Data will be\ncompiled from questionnaires mailed to a random sample of 500 known\nlisteners to KUOW selected from those who have asked to be on its\nprogramming mailing list and from the same number of questionnaires\nmailed to a random sample of the population of the Greater Seattle\narea."
