Ray Cheydleur, who strongly endorsed you, will\nbe sending you the Chairman* s file, and we can go on, into new\nfields, I trust.\nOne of the first orders of business is Research grants-in-aid. We\nhave so far only one application, from Glenn Starlin for a grant\nto a David Lewis, at Oregon. However, you*ll need to designate to\nwhom you*d like these sent, and how you*d like to handle. There\nare not enough copies (we ask for applications in 9 copies, one of\nwhich we should keep for safety-insurance), but I*m afraid 9 legible\ncopies are rarely available. About 5 is all we should count on —\nI*d guess.\nGenerally a sub-committee approach is used in other Committees, each\nfor different projects. Members of such a sub-committee vote, the\nChairman of the sub-committee compfoes the votes and sends us. This\nkeeps us, as we must be, out of any selection process.\nI*d guess there may be more applications. Also we should soon know\nif we have any more than #500.00 for this. So far we don*t, unless\nKeith*s report shows a balance.\nIf you*11 let me know the routing, 1*11 get out what we have.\nYour Committee, in case you hadn*t yet received\n4-\n-Ray Cheydleur\nIrving Merrill\n-Kenneth Harwood-\nI.
