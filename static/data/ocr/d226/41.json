  "text": "In all categories but personalities, more KUOW-FM listeners\nthan non-KUOW-listeners were self-designated influentials, P^.Ol\nin all oases. Only in the ’’personalities\" area did non-KUOW-\nlisteners claim more influence transactions, but the difference was\nnot significant.\nWhen all respondents were ranked on a \"status scale\" developed\nfrom educational and income levels, 55 percent of the KUOW-FM\nlisteners were in the highest ranking, 25 per cent in the medium\nand 20 per cent in the lowest. Of the non-KUOW-listeners, 19 per\ncent were in the highest ranking, 21 per cent in the medium and 60\nper cent in the lowest.\nClassified by the United States Bureau of the Census Classif¬\nication of Jobs and Occupations, 69 per cent of the KUOW-FM\nlisteners vrare found to be in the professional, technical, manager,\nofficial, or proprietor classes. Twenty-eight per oent of the\nnon-KUOW-listeners were so classified. Eighty per cent of the\nKUOW-FM listener influencees were in the professional-proprietor\ngroups. By comparison, 44 per cent of the non-KUOW listener\ninfluencees were in the top groups,\nIn summary, KUOW-FM listeners were found to be more greg¬\narious and of higher status than non-KUOW-listeners, They were\ngenerally better informed, stronger in opinions and more likely to\nrelay opinions to others in the subject areas considered than were\nthe non-KUOW listener sample. Not only did the KUOW-FM listener\ngroup relay personal influence more actively, but, judged by the\noccupational criterion, they were influential within a group more\nhighly placed in the community than those influenced by non-KUOW-\nlisteners"
