My present job is in the production of credit courses\non television at the University of Oregon. Although I have worked with\nDr. John D. Whitney, Mias Charlotte Robineon, and Miss Marie Ernst in\nthe FAB Teaching Project, with Father J.F. Bannon in the series \"Latin\nAmerica\" for ETRC, and currently with Dr. Wendell Stephenson and Dr.\nDonald Tope, I feel the need of further exploration in the techniques\nof television course production. I know from personal experience that\nboth the teachers and producers need greater knowledge in this area.\nMy work of over a year as news director with WTTV gave me further\nexperience in interviewing people which will be helpful in this pro-\nposed research.\nDecember 23, 1957"
