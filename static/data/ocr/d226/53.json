Becker, Director\nDivision of Television, Radio, FM\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nReference is made to Ray Cheydleur’s letter of January 29, addressed\nto you with a copy to Harry.\nHarry is currently out of town, so I thought I would pass this informa¬\ntion along to you. In the past, we have usually given certificates to\nthose attending the various workshops. We agree that it would be a\ngood idea to do the same thing for the Research Seminar, and we will\ndo our best. However, as you recall, the budget for this seminar was\nvery close and we had to pull in money from several budget items, and\nit may not be possible to underwrite the cost of certificates. However,\nwe'11 see what can be done and will keep you advised.\nCordially,\nAssociate Director\nHEH:jg\nCC: Ray Cheydleur"
