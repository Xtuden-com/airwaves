One hundred area cluster samples\nof five each will be drawn from the Greater Seattle population at\nlarge; a random sample from the KUOW list. Mailed questionnaires\nwill contain assurances of anonynity, but self-addressed postcards\nwill be enclosed.\nRespondents will be asked to return the cards separately from\nthe questionnaires. Initial follow-up will be on the basis of\nunretumed cards, followed by a second mailing to those who have\nmisplaced questionnaires. The area cluster sampling method will\nbe used to facilitate in-person interviewing if the rate of nonÂ¬\nreturns is still high enough to bias the sample.\nCompleted questionnaires will be edited, coded, and tabulated\non IBM cards, and computed for each group. Cross-comparisons and\ntests of significance will be made. Results will be reported and\nsummarized; conclusions will be drawn."
