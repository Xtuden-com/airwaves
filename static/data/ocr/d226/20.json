Keith Tyler, Director\nJanuary lli, 1959\nDear Sam:\nThanks for sending me a copy of your letter to Ray Bedwell\nwith regard to his proposal*\nHe and another student have been working on this project for about\na year in their spare time. They have already made contacts with\nnetworks and have seen some of the material that is available.\nThey may be underestimating their time, but they are not acting\ncompletely without background for they have already done preliminary\nwork.\nI certainly want to take advantage of your invitation. I plan to\nbe in New York on March 17th for the Peabody Awards. I probably\nwill look you up that afternoon after we finish our job. 1*11\nsend you more complete information later.
