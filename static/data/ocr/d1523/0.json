This\nInformation was given your secretary by Mr. Ncvlk after a talk\nwith Mr. Early.\nThe letter from RCA~Vlotor, which apparently vent to all radio\nstations, would seem to complicate matters, therefore this morning\nI asked Mr. Novlk by wire to get in touch with Mr. Early and if\npossible get a statement from him on the situation.\nWhen I have further information X shall forward it to you immediately.\nCordially ycurs,.\nrank E.
