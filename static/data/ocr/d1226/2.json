  "text": "Clear Channel Hearing - NAEB\n3\noperation of another against the increased service provided by the\nother station has changed. The true engineering solution must con¬\nsider both of these elements of the problem, each in its proper\nproportion as determined by the criterion of public service. The\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters therefore submits\nthe following specific recommendations in addition to those out¬\nlined in the resolution previously mentioned. 1) Clear channel\nstations should be allowed to serve their primary sphere of in¬\nfluence, which in no case should extend beyond the primary trading\narea of the community in which the station is located. 2) Where it\nis shown that a definite loss of rural service will result from a\nbreakdown of a clear channel and where it is shown that it is not\npossible to equal or better this rural service by the addition of\nnew stations as a result of a breakdown of clear channels, such\nchannels should be protected. 3) Wherever technically feasible,\neducational stations should be given Class II assignments on clear\nchannels to provide adequate service to submarginal areas and to\nmeet the need for educational programs which are often economically\nsubmarglnal for the commercial station. Educational stations only\nare in a position to provide this service. In response to a\nquestionnaire sent to all educational stations, the membership of\nthe National Association of Educational Broadcasters stand ready to\naooept this obligation to improve broadcast service in this country."
